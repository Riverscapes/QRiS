Sampling frames are polygon feature classes that divide up your riverscapes into smaller units. Typically these individual polygons span valley wall to valley wall and longitudinally represent coherent geomorphic units, or uniform sections of river.

Sampling frames are used to define the spatial extent of your [analysis](/software-help/analyses), and to define the spatial units for which you will calculate [metrics](/software-help/metrics).

Sampling frames are stored within QRiS as a polygon feature class. One string attribute column can be specified as the column to be used for labels when the sampling frame is added to the map. This is useful for displaying the name of each polygon on the map. These labels can be brief names or text representations of the polygon ID etc.

## Add an Existing Sampling Frame

You can import an existing polygon feature class and use it as a sampling frame. To do this, right click on the **Sampling Frames** folder within the QRiS [project](/software-help/project) and select the **Add Existing Sampling Frame** menu option. Browse to the location of the polygon feature class and click **Open**. Provide a name and optional description. You can also define key/value pairs of metadata that help describe the origin of the data. Click **OK** to import and create a copy of the feature class will be added to your project.

## Create a New Sampling Frame

You can create a new sampling frame by drawing a polygon on the map. To do this, right click on the **Sampling Frames** folder within the QRiS [project](/software-help/project) and select the **Create New Sampling** menu option. Provide a name and optional description and then click **OK**. Add the Sampling Frame to the map by clicking the **Add to Map** button. You can now use the standard QGIS editing tools to digitize the sampling frame on the map. Remember to stop editing and save your changes before the sampling frame is available for use when importing other data.

## Sampling Frame Polygon Considerations

Because sampling frames are used to define the spatial extent of your [analysis](/software-help/analyses), and to define the spatial units for which you will calculate [metrics](/software-help/metrics), it is important to consider the following when creating your sampling frame:

- Polygons should span valley wall to valley wall.
- Polygons should be mutually exclusive (i.e. no overlap).
- Polygons should, in most cases, be single part features.
- Separate polygons should be used to represent different geomorphic units, uniform sections of river or planning areas.

## Add an Sampling Frame to the Map

You can add a sampling frame to the map by right clicking on any individual sampling frame in the QRiS project tree and selecting **Add to Map**. This will add the sampling frame to the map as a new layer. 

## Edit an Existing Sampling Frame

You can edit a sampling frame by right clicking on any individual sampling frame in the QRiS project tree and selecting **Edit**. This will open the sampling frame in QGIS and allow you to edit the name and description. You can also add the it to the map and use the standard QGIS editing tools to edit the polygons. Remember to stop editing and save your changes before the sampling frame is available for use when importing other data. Layers that have already been imported using the sampling frame will not be updated when you edit the sampling frame. You will need to re-import the layers to see the changes.

## Delete a Sampling Frame

You can delete a sampling frame by right clicking on it in the QRiS project tree and selecting **Delete**. This will remove the sampling frame  from the QRiS project. You will not be able to delete a sampling frame if it is being used by any [analyses](/software-help/analyses). You will need to delete any analyses that use the sampling frame before you can delete it.
