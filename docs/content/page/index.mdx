## QRiS

QGIS Riverscapes Studio or QRiS (pronounced curious) is a flagship, professional-grade tool of the [Riverscapes Consortium](http://riverscapes.net). The free, [open-source software](https://github.com/Riverscapes/QRiS) is a [plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/) to the free, open-source [QGIS](https://plugins.qgis.org/) software. The tool is targeted at anyone interested in understanding and analyzing their riverscape - including:  practitioners, managers, analysts, researchers and students with some familiarity with GIS. It helps users with analysis, monitoring, assessment of riverscapes as well as preparation of the design and as-builts of [low-tech process-based restoration designs](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/resources/Topics/04_Design/). 

**QRiS is in Beta Testing** and is only in the experimental plugin library of GIS. Version 1.0 will be released in late Spring 2023.
