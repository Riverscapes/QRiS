## QRiS

QGIS Riverscapes Studio or QRiS is a plugin that helps you digitize your riverscape data. It provides a flexible, extensible structure for your data, together with consistent symbology to streamline your data capture, monitoring and analysis.

QRiS is a plugin to the free, open-source [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) desktop GIS software. QRiS is targeted at anyone interested in understanding and analyzing their riverscape - including:  practitioners, managers, analysts, researchers and students with some familiarity with GIS. It helps users with analysis, monitoring, assessment of riverscapes as well as preparation of the design and as-builts of low-tech process-based restoration designs.
