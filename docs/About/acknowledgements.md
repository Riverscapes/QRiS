<a href="http://riverscapes.net"><img class="float-left" src="https://rave.riverscapes.net/assets/images/logos/RC_Black.png"></a> QRiS is brought to you for free by the [Riverscapes Consortium](http://riverscapes.net). The goal is to make it quick and easy to capture geospatial data related to rivers, using consistent data formats, attributes and symbology.

## Developers
