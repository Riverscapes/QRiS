## QGIS Installation 

To install QRiS, you'll first need to set up [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), a free and open-source Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software. QRiS functions as a [QGIS Plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/), meaning it relies on QGIS to run.

QGIS is compatible with a variety of operating systems, including **Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android**. When choosing a QGIS version, you'll see two main types: **Experimental (latest) Releases and Long Term Releases (LTR)**. LTR versions are generally more stable, while Experimental Releases offer the latest features.

**QRiS is designed to work with the latest QGIS LTR**, so be sure to install that version (found [here](https://qgis.org/download/)). If a specific QGIS version is required for a particular QRiS release, this information will be provided in the [release notes](https://github.com/Riverscapes/QRiS/releases) or as a pop-up within the QGIS Plugin Manager.

## QRiS Installation

QRiS can be installed from the QGIS Plugin Manager. However, you must have the latest version of [Riverscapes Viewer](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/) before installing QRiS. To install QRiS, follow these steps: 
    1. **First, install the Riverscapes Viewer Plugin**:
        +In the QGIS menubar (top of page), go to Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins 
        +Search for 'Riverscapes Viewer' and click the ‘Install’ button (should take less than 30 seconds). This is a required dependency for QRiS.
    2. **Then, install QRiS**:
        +Go to the same Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins and search for 'QRiS' (should take less than 30 seconds).
        +Click the 'Install' button.

## Updating QRiS 

You can update QRiS at any time after installation through the **QGIS Plugin Manager**. Here's how:

    1. Go to Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins.
    2. Select **QRiS** from the list of installed plugins.
    3. Click the **'Update' button**.

For automatic updates, you can configure the Plugin Manager settings to Check for Updates on Startup. When enabled:

    +QGIS will notify you periodically (every 3 days) upon startup if any installed plugin, including QRiS, has an available update.
    +To apply the update, simply click the **'Update' button** that appears on the blue taskbar in the map panel.

## Release Notes 

Each release of QRiS comes with supplementary [release notes](https://github.com/Riverscapes/QRiS/releases), which are readily available in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Riverscapes/QRiS/releases). These notes detail all **new features introduced or bugs that have been fixed**, including their associated issue number for easy reference.
