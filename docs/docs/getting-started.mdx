QRiS is a **free, open source** data management software that standardizes the collection and analysis of riverscape GIS (Geographic Information Systems) spatial data. It provides a robust suite of built-in tools to streamline data collection, organize cumbersome datasets, and simplify complex metric analysis. This allows users to support their restoration projects from **initial design** to the **finalized as-built** and even **ongoing monitoring** efforts. Furthermore, QRiS integrates with the Riverscapes Consortium, allowing users to share and promote their restoration efforts with the broader community. 

This tool is intended for individuals with a **working knowledge of riverscapes and process-based restoration** including practitioners, managers, analysts, and researchers. A **fundamental understanding of GIS** and its application to riverscapes is required for effective use of this tool.

## How to Download QRiS

QRiS is a plugin for **QGIS**, the widely used free and open source GIS software. For optimal performance and stability, it is recommended to use the latest **Long Term Release** (LTR) version, available for download from the QGIS Website. 

To install QRiS in QGIS, follow these steps:

1. **First, install the Riverscapes Viewer Plugin**:

    - In QGIS, go to `Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins`. 

    - Search for *Riverscapes Viewer* and install the latest version. This is a required dependency for QRiS.

    - Click the *Install* button. 

2. **Then, install QRiS**:

    - In the same `Manage and Install Plugins` window under `Plugins`, search for *QRiS*.

    - Click the *Install* button.

## What can you do in QRiS

### Creating a Project 

QRiS projects are the primary organizational unit, **storing all spatial data, imagery, analysis, and supporting information related to a riverscape**. While typically focused at the reach scale, QRiS offers the flexibility to integrate data at network or watershed scales, especially when utilizing coarser datasets (e.g., watershed networks or Digital Elevation Models) for broader riverscape context. 

QRiS supports the use of infinite projects to contextualize a riverscape. Each project is stored as a **GeoPackage**, a single file container for all associated data, enhancing both project organization and sharing. 

To create a new project, navigate to the QRiS menu bar and select `New Project`. You will be prompted to enter a **Name** and **Project Path**. The **Project Path** specifies the location (typically a folder) **where your QRiS project is saved**. The project **Name** creates a new subfolder within the pathway to **store all QRiS data**.    

You can also include a **Description** or **Tags**. Although not required, these fields are helpful for **long-term tracking and recall** of QRiS projects, especially as your project library grows over time.  

For more detailed information, please refer to our [Software](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/) Help page.

### Digitizing & Importing Data 

QRiS utilizes a diverse collection of data layers to promote the **visualization of riverscapes over time**. Users can **digitize** both **static** (e.g., valley bottom) and **dynamic** (e.g., active channel) features to foster a deeper **understanding of the processes that shape the riverscape**. Furthermore, users can organize digitized data into designs, as-builts, pre-project surveys, or post-project monitoring to **inform and aid in key management decisions**.  

Users can also **import data from pre-existing datasets** into QRiS as an alternative to manual digitization. This feature allows for quick incorporation of historical or external vector and raster data, resulting in more robust, comprehensive, and dynamic projects.

For more detailed information, please refer to our [Software](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/) Help page.

### Analyses 

One of the most powerful features of QRiS is its ability to **generate metrics** from digitized or imported data, providing a **quantitative assessment of riverscape health**. The results are presented in both **tables and graphs**, illustrating metric evolution **over time** and facilitating **direct comparisons between different riverscapes**. This functionality supports the analysis of **discrete events** (e.g., single riverscape assessment) or **chronological data** (e.g., series of restoration treatments or or continuous monitoring). A wide range of metric types, including counts, lengths, densities, areas, gradients, and ratios, are supported and customizable with user input. All metric data is exportable to **CSV, Excel, or JSON formats**. 

For more detailed information, please refer to our [Analyses](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/analyses) and [Technical Reference](https://qris.riverscapes.net/technical-reference/) pages.

### Sharing Projects 

Once your QRiS project is finalized, you can **share it with other organizations, clients, and community members** through the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net/). When uploaded to the Data Exchange, QRiS projects function as **‘living documents’**. This means others can **download, modify, and even overwrite** your existing version on the Exchange with new data, analyses, or contextual information. 

Given this collaborative setting, it is highly recommended to **keep backup copies of your project** and prevent accidental data loss or unintended changes to your original work.  

For more detailed information, please refer to our [Riverscapes Viewer Integration](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/riverscapes-viewer-integration) page.

### Protocol Library 

The Protocol Library allows users to **customize both layers and metric calculations** within QRiS. While QRiS comes with pre-built layers and metrics outlined by the [LTPBR V2 Protocol](https://zenodo.org/records/13769899), not all restoration and monitoring efforts will follow these exact  guidelines. You can **develop uniquely defined layers and metrics** tailored to specific **agency requirements**, the diverse **constraints of your riverscape**, or capture discrete details needed for **comprehensive assessments**. 

For more detailed information, please refer to our [Protocol Library](https://qris.riverscapes.net/technical-reference/protocol-library) page.
