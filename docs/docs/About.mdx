QGIS Riverscapes Studio or QRiS (pronounced curious) is a professional-grade tool of the [Riverscapes Consortium](http://riverscapes.net). The free, [open-source software](https://github.com/Riverscapes/QRiS) is a [plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/) to the similarly free and open-source [QGIS](https://plugins.qgis.org/) software. 

QRiS is targeted at anyone interested in understanding and analyzing their riverscape - practitioners, managers, analysts, researchers and students  - with some familiarity with GIS. It helps users with analysis, monitoring, assessment of riverscapes as well as preparation of the design and as-builts of [low-tech process-based restoration designs](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/resources/Topics/04_Design/). 

## Funding

We are grateful to generous grant support from early adopters for the vision behind the Riverscape Studio at the [Bureau of Land Management](https://www.blm.gov/programs/aquatics), the [US Forest Service](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r4/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=stelprd3845865), [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center), [NRCS Working Lands for Wildlife](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/programs/initiatives/?cid=stelprdb1046975) and [Anabranch Solutions](https://anabranchsolutons.com) who funded the professional software development of QRiS.  Without their support, this free software would not exist.

The [US Forest Service](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r4/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=stelprd3845865), [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center), [NRCS Working Lands for Wildlife](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/programs/initiatives/?cid=stelprdb1046975) and [Anabranch Solutions](https://anabranchsolutons.com) were early supporters who paid for development of proof of concepts and alpha pre-release versions of the code.  


Specifically, the following supporters and visionaries behind the [Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/) made QRiS a reality by raising the funds to develop it.

- [Chris Jordan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chris-Jordan-7) ([NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center))
- [Joe Wheaton](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joseph_Wheaton), [Steve Bennett](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephen_Bennett8) and [Nick Bouwes](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nick_Bouwes) ([Anabranch Solutions](https://anabranchsolutons.com))

## Development Team

QRiS is developed by [North Arrow Research](http://northarrowresearch.com). The QRiS Development Team is led by [Philip Bailey](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philip-Bailey-2) (Owner of [North Arrow Research](http://northarrowresearch.com) and Adjunct Professor at [Utah State University](https://qcnr.usu.edu/wats/)) and [Joseph Wheaton](http://joewheaton.org) (Professor of Riverscapes at Utah State University). The initial plugin was set up by [Kelly Whitehead](https://github.com/KellyMWhitehead) and the early releases bringing the LTPBR design functionality were developed by [Nick Weber](https://github.com/nick4rivers). See [Contributors on GitHub](https://github.com/Riverscapes/QRiS/graphs/contributors) for the full list of code contributors to QRiS.
