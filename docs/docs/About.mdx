QGIS Riverscapes Studio or QRiS (pronounced curious) is a flagship, professional-grade tool of the [Riverscapes Consortium](http://riverscapes.net). This free, [open-source software](https://github.com/Riverscapes/QRiS) is available to anyone interested in understanding and analyzing riverscapes. It helps users with analysis, monitoring, and assessment of riverscapes, and the preparation of designs and as-builts for [low-tech process-based restoration projects](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/resources/Topics/04_Design/). 

## Funding

We are grateful for the early support of [Bureau of Land Management](https://www.blm.gov/programs/aquatics), the [US Forest Service](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r4/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=stelprd3845865), [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center), [NRCS Working Lands for Wildlife](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/programs/initiatives/?cid=stelprdb1046975) and [Anabranch Solutions](https://anabranchsolutons.com) who not only developed the vision behind QRiS, but provided the resources to make it a reality.   

The [US Forest Service](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/dr4/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=stelprd3845865), [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center), [NRCS Working Lands for Wildlife](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/programs/initiatives/?cid=stelprdb1046975) and [Anabranch Solutions](https://anabranchsolutons.com) were instrumental in the early development of QRiS. They provided the necessary funds and support for testing proof of concepts and alpha pre-release versions of the code.
