## Overview to CEWA/WATS 6627 
This is the main resource page for the [CEWA/WATS 6627](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/WATS-6627/) - Advanced LTPBR Design course offered at Utah State University. This course is part of an [advanced series](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/) of courses on Low Tech Process Based Restoration (LTPBR) offered through USU and the Riverscapes Consortium. The course is designed to provide hands-on experience with LTPBR planning using [QRiS](https://qris.riverscapes.net) and is a direct follow up to the [Introduction to LTPBR Design](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/WATS-5623/) in the Intro to LTPBR Spring Series.

> **Description:** Advanced course in site-scale design of LTPBR project using Riverscapes Studio. Students will conduct desktop designs and prepare design report. One-week short course remotely over video meetings. Prerequisite recommendations: Students are recommended to be proficient in GIS.

## Prerequisites and Preparing for Class
### Background or Catch-Up Reading
We assume you have read and are familiar with [Chapter 4](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap04/) and [Chapter 5](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap05/)  of the Design Manual. This was assigned in WATS 5623/CEWA 5623, but if you have not taken that course, please read it now. If you have not taken WATS 5623/CEWA 5623, you should watch the [self-paced lecures](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module4/). 

This course will be focused on how we quanatitative use mapping and analysis in QRiS to build off of these concepts from the Intro to Planning course:
