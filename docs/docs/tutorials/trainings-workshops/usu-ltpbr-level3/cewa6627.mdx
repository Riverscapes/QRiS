## Prerequisites and Preparing for Class
### Background or Catch-Up Reading
We assume you have read and are familiar with [Chapter 4](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap04/) and [Chapter 5](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap05/)  of the Design Manual. This was assigned in WATS 5623/CEWA 5623, but if you have not taken that course, please read it now. If you have not taken WATS 5623/CEWA 5623, you should watch the [self-paced lecures](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module4/). 

This course will be focused on how we quanatitative use mapping and analysis in QRiS to build off of these concepts from the Intro to LTPBR Design course:

## Main Assignment
The main outcome of this workshop is to **complete a LTPBR Design** for a single phase of a project in a project reach of your choosing (preverably the site you used in the Planning Class) using QRiS. 

You will:
1. Complete a Riverscapes LTPBR Design Report (through design section of [template](#report-template)) with your supporting maps and analyses using QRiS. This report will be saved as a PDF, and added as an [attatchment](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/attachments/) to your Riverscapes Studio Project.
2. Update your [QRiS Project from Planning Class](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/projects), and [export as updated Riverscapes Studio Project](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/projects#export-to-riverscapes-project) (or make new one if you don't yet have one) and [publish](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/tutorials/riverscapes-project-data-exchnage/) to the [Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net). *We do not advise your to do a design without having completed a planning assessment first. However, you can still do the techical steps of creating a design, it just will not be as well informed as it could be if you had done a planning assessment first.*
3. Create or update a *draft* [PBR Explorer](https://pbr.riverscapes.net) Project Entry for Proposed Work. You can optionally make this private and part of a Data Exchange Organization you create that you give instructor access to.
4. Present a 10 minute presentation on Thursday of your project to the class. 
5. Post a link to your presentation and Riverscapes Studio Project in the [Riverscapes Consortium Community](https://www.riverscapes.net/topics/45485/feed).

:::tip
**Yes, you can build off what you started.** For those of you that completed the [WATS/CEWA 5623 Introduction to Planning Course](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/WATS-5623/), you will already have chosen a site, and have the start of a report and design. It is perfectly reasonable to pick up the old report and the same design and just re-do and expand a more througough analysis and design report using QRiS. It is also accepable to pick a new site and start fresh. 

Those that have not taken WATS 5622 or did not complete that course assignment, will need to pick a site and write a report from scratch.

## Assignment Resources
This section elaborates on some of the questions you engage with in the Design portion of  Conservation Planning Process (CPP) adapted from Bennett et al. (2019) and outlined in Chapter 3 of the LTPBR Design Manual.  

:::tip
If this class was in person, we would use Monday to approximate answers to these questions at the desktop and with freely available data. We would use Tuesday to get out in the field, see how good our desktop design was, fill in gaps of our ounderstanding from the desktop, and refine our design based on on-the-ground assesment. Then we would use Wednesday to pull together both field and desktop evidence, and have a revised design. You can do this on your own with the riverscapes you work in.
:::

### Report Template

You can make your own report, or you can use [this Google Docs template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Su6NV2mZ4Z8f3hJI7gtVs-DWKYRSYGbIcKJLadyrGL8/edit?usp=sharing) for the report. You can expand and refine the section headings as you see fit, but you need to minimally include these sections and answer the questions posed. 

If you do use a Google Doc, please share it with your instructor(s), so they can give you suggestions when you submit your project. You may choose to add other students, or make it visible to those with the link. 

We show you how to use it in this video:
<YouTubeEmbed videoId="NyxCr0p9XHU" />
:::note
When you submit your assignment, *please* do not submit it as a link to the Google Doc. Instead, export it as a PDF and submit the PDF as an attatchment in your Riverscapes Studio Project.
:::

#### Using Zotero Cite While You Write Add-ON
*Optional*: [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) is a powerful and free citation and bibliography manager (alternative to EndNote), which you can use to keep track of your citations. [This help reference](https://www.zotero.org/support/google_docs) explains how to use Zotero with Google Docs. You will need [Zotero Connector Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zotero-connector/ekhagklcjbdpajgpjgmbionohlpdbjgc?hl=en) installed in your browser for it tow work with Google Docs.

In class, we will work through exercises to practice the steps of LTPBR Planning using QRiS. We will use freely available datasets from the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net/) to create a QRiS project for a hypothetical assessment of Fall Creek, Wyoming.  

:::tip
In general, you will be expected to apply what we cover in exercises to your own project for the [assignment](#main-assignment).
:::

### A. Informing and Leading Design with Planning: Recovery Potential, Resource Inventory & Conditions 

1. Review of Recovery Potential, Risk Assessment, and Geomorphic Units from previous class and how they apply as context to inform the designing process.
    - Geomorphic Units: valley bottom (channel, active floodplain, inactive floodplain) and valley (terrace, moraine, alluvial & colluvial fans) geomorphic units (i.e., building blocks of the riverscape). For designs, we are interested in converting inactive floodplains to either active floodplain or active channel.  
    - Active Margins: abutment of channel against valley bottom, valley, and/or anthropogenic margin. For designs, we will avoid these locations as they have limited recovery potential and can pose potential risks to infrastructure (if listed as anthropogenic margin). 
    - Risk Potential: infrastructure, land use, and other anthropogenic features that should be avoided in restoration implementation especially when classified at medium to high risk.  
    - Recovery Potential: portion of valley bottom available for restoration practices and structure implementation (i.e., where the design will be implemented at). 

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="uLZypo77IIA" />

### B. Adding A Design to QRiS

1. Right click on `Data Capture Events`, select `Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration`, and click on `Add New Design`. 
2. Name your design project (e.g., Phase 1 Design)
3. Add relevant design layers to your project from the **Design Protocol** in the `Available Layers` panel to the `Layers in Use` panel 
4. Fill out metadata values under `Basic Properties`, including *Associated Valley Bottom*, *Project Phase*, *Design Date(s)*, *Design Status*, *Designers, and *Design Sources* relevant to your project. 
5. Under `Bases for Design`, select raster layers and/or Data Capture Events that will be used as context for your design. 
6. (Optional) Fill out descriptive narratives (project goals, riverscape constraints, etc.) and other relevant details (web links, YouTube videos, etc.) about your design under the `Description` and `Metadata` tabs. 

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="6owkua-8DDY" />

### C. Overview of Design Layers

1. Once your design is created and is displayed in the Data Capture Events bin, right click on it and select `Add All Layers to the Map`. 
2. Layers in Design Protocol 
    - Observation Layers
        - Observation Points: point feature(s) of design logistics, riverscape features of note, design considerations, building materials, photo observations, caution, and other important features related to the design
        - Observation Polygons: line feature(s) of building materials, caution, infrastructure, logistics and other important features related to the design
        - Observation Lines: polygon feature(s) of caution, logistics, riverscape features of note, roads, and other important features related to the design 
    - Structure Layers 
        - Structure Points: point feature(s) of design structure; shows location of structure
        - Structure Lines: line feature(s) of design structure; shows location, length, and orientation of structure 
    - Complex & ZOI Layers
        - Structure Complex Extents: polygon area where multiple structures work together to achieve a common objective
        - Zones of Influence: anticipated areal effect that complex (i.e., multiple structures) or individual structure will influence and its stated objective 
3. Toggle on `Editing` for *Observation* layers (can be either point, line, or polygon layer) to digitize and highlight important riverscape features, logistics, and potential constraints for the design (staging areas, where to get material, site access, etc.) before digitizing structure points/lines & complexes/ZOI

![Observation Layers](/images/tutorials/Observation-Layers-Design.png)

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="wkn5tusiPbk" />

### D. Structure Scale Design & ZOIs

1. Toggle on `Editing` for the *Structure Lines* layer to digitize PALS - Bank Blaster Structures (see slides 16-24 in Module E). Right click when done to open the attribute window. 
2. Select *PALS - Bank Blaster* from dropdown menu under *Structure Type* for each structure digitized.  
3. Once complete, turn off `Editing` for the *Structure Lines* layer and select the *Zones of Influence* (ZOI)  layer and toggle on `Editing` for that layer. 
4. Digitize ZOI for the Bank Blaster Structures and right click when done to open the attribute window. 
5. Select *Structure: Geomorphic - Erode Bank* under the dropdown menu for *ZOI Type* and *Typical Flood* under the dropdown menu for *Stage*. 
6. Repeat steps 1-5 to add Primary & Secondary BDAs. For step 2, we will select *Primary BDA* & *Secondary BDA* for *Structure Type* and for step 5,  we will select *Structure: Hydraulic - Overflow* & *Structure: Hydraulic - Ponding Flow* for ZOI Type for digitized BDA features. 

![Structure Layers](/images/tutorials/Structure-Complex-ZOI-Layers-Design.png)

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="lSMUWO9vYyk" />

### E. Complex Scale Design & ZOIs

1. We will repeat steps 1-5 in *Section D* to digitize design structures except we will be doing this for multiple complexes with stated objectives instead of at the structure scale (see slide 36 in Module 4D as example). 
2. Once all design features are digitized, we will then digitize complex ZOIs by selecting the *Zones of Influence* layer and toggle on `Editing`. 
3. After digitizing the ZOI, right click to bring up the attribute window and select *Complex: Pond/Wetland Creation* for *ZOI Type* and *Baseflow* for *Stage*. 

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="FcWePJZhSg0" />

### F. Design Packaging

1. We will upload your completed design report to the *Attachments* bin in QRiS See slide 13 from Module 4D for more information on components for Design reporting. 
2. Right click on the *Attachments* bin in the QRiS plugin window, and select *Add New File Attachment*. 
3. Find where your design report is located and select it in the Browser window and click on `Open`. 
4. In the Import Attachments Window, you can rename your report (or keep its default name) and click `Ok`. 
5. We will update your QRiS project w/design report in the Data Exchange by following the same steps to upload a QRiS project to the Exchange except we will change `Export Type` in the Export Project window from *New Riverscapes Studio Project* to *Update Existing Riverscapes Studio Project* (see video below for the full upload process). 

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="eOSFg83Jk4c" />

### G. As-Builts

Overview of ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Products that collect offline as-built data (FieldMaps & Survey123) and how offline layers are organized 

#### Importing AGOL Offline Data into QRiS

1. Download offline data and add to QGIS project (in this example, offline data was downloaded from AGOL Experience Builder) 
2. Right click on `Data Capture Events` bin, select `Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration` and click on `Add New As-Built Survey` to create a new as-built event. 
3. Select the relevant as-built layers you want to add from the *As-Built Protocol* to the `Layers in Use` panel. 
4. Fill out relevant metadata values under `Basic Properties`, including *Valley Bottom*, *Associated Design*, *As-Built Phase*, *Survey & Construction Date(s)*, *Observerors*, and *Survey Sources* relevant to your project. 
5. Under `Bases for As-Built`, select raster layers and/or Data Capture Events that will be used as context for your as-built. 
6. (Optional) Fill out descriptive narratives and other relevant details about your as-built under the `Description` and `Metadata` tabs. 
7. Once complete, right click on the newly created as-built event in the Data Capture Events bin and select `Add All Layers to the Map`.
8. Expand the As-Built Event and right click on the the Structure Points/Lines layer, select `Import Features From...`, and click on `Layer in Map`. 
9. Select the layer that contains your survey data. 
10. A new window will appear where you can copy structure values from your survey date and add those to your QRiS As-Built. To do so, find the field that contains the structure type values in your survey data and click on the `Assign` button under the *Transfer Values* field. 
11. Another window will appear where you can correlate the structure type values in your survey data to the ones listed in the As-Built Protocol. 
12. Click `Ok` once you are done assigning values.
13. (Optional) You can also assign other fields as notes/comments by check marking the box next to `Notes` under the *Copy Values* field for the relevant field storing notes/comments. You can also keep any field in your survey data as metadata (i.e., added as seperate field in QRiS). 
14. Click `Ok` once you are done assigning values and the Structure Points/Lines layer should populate with features.

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="YjaluN5lnCw" />

#### Exporting QRIS Data to As-Built Survey in AGOL

2. Click and drag As-Built Structure Points/Lines layer(s) from the Layer panel and drop into the newly formed geoapckage. 
3. Open ArcPro and add AGOL As-Built survey to map. 
4. Add the QRiS data stored in the geopackage to the map by finding the geopackage, expanding it, and dragging the layer(s) into the map.
5. Find the `Append` tool. 
6. Once opened, fill out the `Target Dataset` with your AGOL As-Built data, the `Input Datasets` with your QRiS data, and select the *Use the field map to reconcile field differencex* option under `Field Matching Type`. 
7. Align the QRiS fields with the corresponding AGOL fields by selecting the pencil icon under each field and selecting the appropriate field in the popup window that appears. 
8. Click `Run` to append the dataset.
