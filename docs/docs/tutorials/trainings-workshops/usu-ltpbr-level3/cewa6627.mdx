## Overview to CEWA/WATS 6627 
This is the main resource page for the [CEWA/WATS 6627](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/WATS-6627/) - Advanced LTPBR Design course offered at Utah State University. This course is part of an [advanced series](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/) of courses on Low Tech Process Based Restoration (LTPBR) offered through USU and the Riverscapes Consortium. The course is designed to provide hands-on experience with LTPBR planning using [QRiS](https://qris.riverscapes.net) and is a direct follow up to the [Introduction to LTPBR Design](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/WATS-5623/) in the Intro to LTPBR Spring Series.

> **Description:** Advanced course in site-scale design of LTPBR project using Riverscapes Studio. Students will conduct desktop designs and prepare design report. One-week short course remotely over video meetings. Prerequisite recommendations: Students are recommended to be proficient in GIS.

## Prerequisites and Preparing for Class
### Background or Catch-Up Reading
We assume you have read and are familiar with [Chapter 4](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap04/) and [Chapter 5](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap05/)  of the Design Manual. This was assigned in WATS 5623/CEWA 5623, but if you have not taken that course, please read it now. If you have not taken WATS 5623/CEWA 5623, you should watch the [self-paced lecures](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module4/). 

This course will be focused on how we quanatitative use mapping and analysis in QRiS to build off of these concepts from the Intro to LTPBR Design course:

    ### Software Requirements
- Install QGiS and the [QRiS](https://qris.riverscapes.net/download) and [Riverscapes Viewer](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/Deploy/install-qgis/) Plugins (see [here](https://qris.riverscapes.net/download)).

:::warning
If you did not take the [prerequisite planning course](/tutorials/trainings-workshops/usu-ltpbr-level3/cewa6626), please review the [software installation instructions](http://127.0.0.1:8006/tutorials/trainings-workshops/usu-ltpbr-level3/cewa6626#a-install-and-open-project) and ensure you have QGiS, the QRiS plugin, and the Riverscapes Viewer plugin installed and working before the first day of class. If you need help with this, please show up on Monday morning at 8:45 AM instead of 9:00 AM.

## Main Assignment
The main outcome of this workshop is to **complete a LTPBR Design** for a single phase of a project in a project reach of your choosing (preverably the site you used in the Planning Class) using QRiS. 

You will:
1. Complete a Riverscapes LTPBR Design Report (through design section of [template](#report-template)) with your supporting maps and analyses using QRiS. This report will be saved as a PDF, and added as an [attatchment](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/attachments/) to your Riverscapes Studio Project.
2. Update your [QRiS Project from Planning Class](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/projects), and [export as updated Riverscapes Studio Project](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/projects#export-to-riverscapes-project) (or make new one if you don't yet have one) and [publish](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/tutorials/riverscapes-project-data-exchnage/) to the [Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net). *We do not advise your to do a design without having completed a planning assessment first. However, you can still do the techical steps of creating a design, it just will not be as well informed as it could be if you had done a planning assessment first.*
3. Create or update a *draft* [PBR Explorer](https://pbr.riverscapes.net) Project Entry for Proposed Work. You can optionally make this private and part of a Data Exchange Organization you create that you give instructor access to.
4. Present a 10 minute presentation on Thursday of your project to the class. 
5. Post a link to your presentation and Riverscapes Studio Project in the [Riverscapes Consortium Community](https://www.riverscapes.net/topics/45485/feed).

:::tip
**Yes, you can build off what you started.** For those of you that completed the [WATS/CEWA 5623 Introduction to Planning Course](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/WATS-5623/), you will already have chosen a site, and have the start of a report and design. It is perfectly reasonable to pick up the old report and the same design and just re-do and expand a more througough analysis and design report using QRiS. It is also accepable to pick a new site and start fresh. 

Those that have not taken WATS 5622 or did not complete that course assignment, will need to pick a site and write a report from scratch.

## Assignment Resources
This section elaborates on some of the questions you engage with in the Design portion of  Conservation Planning Process (CPP) adapted from Bennett et al. (2019) and outlined in Chapter 3 of the LTPBR Design Manual.  

:::tip
If this class was in person, we would use Monday to approximate answers to these questions at the desktop and with freely available data. We would use Tuesday to get out in the field, see how good our desktop design was, fill in gaps of our ounderstanding from the desktop, and refine our design based on on-the-ground assesment. Then we would use Wednesday to pull together both field and desktop evidence, and have a revised design. You can do this on your own with the riverscapes you work in.
:::

### Report Template

You can make your own report, or you can use [this Google Docs template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Su6NV2mZ4Z8f3hJI7gtVs-DWKYRSYGbIcKJLadyrGL8/edit?usp=sharing) for the report. You can expand and refine the section headings as you see fit, but you need to minimally include these sections and answer the questions posed. 

If you do use a Google Doc, please share it with your instructor(s), so they can give you suggestions when you submit your project. You may choose to add other students, or make it visible to those with the link. 

We show you how to use it in this video:
<YouTubeEmbed videoId="NyxCr0p9XHU" />
:::note
When you submit your assignment, *please* do not submit it as a link to the Google Doc. Instead, export it as a PDF and submit the PDF as an attatchment in your Riverscapes Studio Project.
:::

#### Using Zotero Cite While You Write Add-ON
*Optional*: [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) is a powerful and free citation and bibliography manager (alternative to EndNote), which you can use to keep track of your citations. [This help reference](https://www.zotero.org/support/google_docs) explains how to use Zotero with Google Docs. You will need [Zotero Connector Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zotero-connector/ekhagklcjbdpajgpjgmbionohlpdbjgc?hl=en) installed in your browser for it tow work with Google Docs.

In class, we will work through exercises to practice the steps of LTPBR Planning using QRiS. We will use freely available datasets from the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net/) to create a QRiS project for a hypothetical assessment of Fall Creek, Wyoming.  

:::tip
In general, you will be expected to apply what we cover in exercises to your own project for the [assignment](#main-assignment).
