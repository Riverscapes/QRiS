This is the main resource page for the [CEWA/WATS 6628](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/WATS-6628/) - *Introduction to Action-Effectiveness Monitoring of Riverscape Restoration Projects* course offered through [Utah State University](https://qanr.usu.edu/wats/restoration/). This course is part of an [advanced series](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/) of courses on Low Tech Process Based Restoration (LTPBR) offered through USU and the [Riverscapes Consortium](https://riverscapes.net). The course is designed to provide hands-on experience with monitoring of riverscapes using [QRiS](https://qris.riverscapes.net). This course compliments the [Introduction to LTPBR Design](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/WATS-5623/) in the Intro to LTPBR Spring Series and most directly follows on to concepts in the [Advanced LTPBR Planning (CEWA/WATS 6626)](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/WATS-6626) course.

> **Description:** Students learn how to monitor and assess riverscape health through a mix of desktop and field work. They conduct assessments in [Riverscapes Studio](https://riverscapes.net), publish their findings, and present to peers.

## Prerequisites and Preparing for Class
### Background or Catch-Up Reading
The course is built around monitoring of riverscapes, and seeks to monitor metrics that relate to riverscape health. In Wheaton et al. (2019) and Glassic et al. (2025), Principles of Riverscape Health are introduced that form the basis for understanding how to monitor riverscapes.
- Glassic, H. C., Al-Chokhachy, R., Wheaton, J., Macfarlane, W. W., Jordan, C. E., Murphy, B., et al. (2025). Principles of Riverscape Health. WIREs Water, 12(4), e70028. DOI:[10.1002/wat2.70028](https://doi.org/10.1002/wat2.70028)

As one example of one set of metrics related to one principle of riverscape health (hydrologic ineffiency is healthy) we refer you to Bartelt et al. (2025) based on the Riverscapes Innundation Mapping protocol:
-  Bartelt, K. M. (2025). Mapping valley bottom inundation patterns from beaver dam activity: A potential proxy for hydrologic inefficiency. PLOS Water, 4(11), e0000428. DOI: [10.1371/journal/pwat.0000428](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal/pwat.0000428)


We assume you have read and are familiar with [Chapter 2](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap02/) and [Chapter 3](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap03/)  of the Design Manual. This was assigned in WATS 5623/CEWA 5623, but if you have not taken that course, please read it now. If you have not taken WATS 5623/CEWA 5623, you should watch the [self-paced lecures](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module3/).

This course will be focused on how we quanatitative use monitoring, mapping and analysis in QRiS to build off of the concepts from the [Intro to LTPBR course](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module1/) and [Intro to LTPBR Planning course](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module3/):

    ### Software Requirements
- Install QGiS and the [QRiS](https://qris.riverscapes.net/download) and [Riverscapes Viewer](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/Deploy/install-qgis/) Plugins (see [here](https://qris.riverscapes.net/download)).

:::warning
If you did not take the [planning course](/tutorials/trainings-workshops/usu-ltpbr-level3/cewa6626), please review the [software installation instructions](/tutorials/trainings-workshops/usu-ltpbr-level3/cewa6626#a-install-and-open-project) and ensure you have QGiS, the QRiS plugin, and the Riverscapes Viewer plugin installed and working before the first day of class. If you need help with this, please show up on Monday morning at 8:45 AM instead of 9:00 AM.
