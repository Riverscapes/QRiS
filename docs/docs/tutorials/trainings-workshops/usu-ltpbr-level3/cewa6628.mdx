This is the main resource page for the [CEWA/WATS 6628](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/WATS-6628/) - *Introduction to Action-Effectiveness Monitoring of Riverscape Restoration Projects* course offered through [Utah State University](https://qanr.usu.edu/wats/restoration/). This course is part of an [advanced series](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/) of courses on Low Tech Process Based Restoration (LTPBR) offered through USU and the [Riverscapes Consortium](https://riverscapes.net). The course is designed to provide hands-on experience with monitoring of riverscapes using [QRiS](https://qris.riverscapes.net). This course compliments the [Introduction to LTPBR Design](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/WATS-5623/) in the Intro to LTPBR Spring Series and most directly follows on to concepts in the [Advanced LTPBR Planning (CEWA/WATS 6626)](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/WATS-6626) course.

## Prerequisites and Preparing for Class
### Background or Catch-Up Reading
The course is built around monitoring of riverscapes, and seeks to monitor metrics that relate to riverscape health. In Wheaton et al. (2019) and Glassic et al. (2025), Principles of Riverscape Health are introduced that form the basis for understanding how to monitor riverscapes.
- Glassic, H. C., Al-Chokhachy, R., Wheaton, J., Macfarlane, W. W., Jordan, C. E., Murphy, B., et al. (2025). Principles of Riverscape Health. WIREs Water, 12(4), e70028. DOI:[10.1002/wat2.70028](https://doi.org/10.1002/wat2.70028)

As one example of one set of metrics related to one principle of riverscape health (hydrologic ineffiency is healthy) we refer you to Bartelt et al. (2025) based on the Riverscapes Innundation Mapping protocol:
-  Bartelt, K. M. (2025). Mapping valley bottom inundation patterns from beaver dam activity: A potential proxy for hydrologic inefficiency. PLOS Water, 4(11), e0000428. DOI: [10.1371/journal/pwat.0000428](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal/pwat.0000428)


We assume you have read and are familiar with [Chapter 2](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap02/) and [Chapter 3](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/manual/chap03/)  of the Design Manual. This was assigned in WATS 5623/CEWA 5623, but if you have not taken that course, please read it now. If you have not taken WATS 5623/CEWA 5623, you should watch the [self-paced lecures](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2020/SGI/Modules/module3/).

## Main Assignment
The main outcome of this workshop is to **complete a riverscape health monitoring analysis** with multi-temporal monitoring at a site. For this class, you will only be expected to complete this for data we provide and you create at Spawn Creek.  

You will:
1. Prepare new [data capture events](/software-help/dce/) for Spawn Creek for imagery from 2006, 2021 and 2024. You will digitize beaver dams using basemaps provided to you. For extra credit (or a good feeling), you can figure out how to do a fourth DCE From 2025 in Google Earth and import it. Digitize beaver dam locations using the *Structural Element survey* in the [LTPBR V2 Protocol](/technical-reference/protocols/protocol-library/dce-protocols/ltpbr-dce-protocol) in each DCE.
2. Combining your data capture events with those we provided to you (from 2011, 2014, 2016 & 2017), perform an analysis of beaver dam activity for all of Spawn Creek as well as broken into discrete reaches. You will calculate the following metrics for each time period and changes between time periods:
    - Number of dams
    - Density of dams (dams/km)
    - Change in number of dams
    - Change in density of dams
Produce maps, tables and graphs to present your findings.   
3. Create a small report as a PDF, and added as an [attatchment](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/attachments/) to your Riverscapes Studio Project. Your report should follow a standard format (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusions, References) and include:
    - Introduction: Brief introduction to the site and why monitoring beaver dams is important to riverscape health.
    - Methods: Description of how you created your DCEs, how you digitized dams, and how you calculated metrics.
    - Results: Maps, tables and graphs of your findings.
    - Discussion: Interpretation of your results. What do they mean for riverscape health at Spawn Creek? What are the limitations of your analysis?
    - Conclusions: Summary of key findings and their implications for future monitoring and management at Spawn Creek.
    - References: Cite any sources you used in your report.
2. Upload your analysis as a [QRiS Project](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/projects) by [exporting as Riverscapes Studio Project](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/projects#export-to-riverscapes-project) and [publish](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/tutorials/riverscapes-project-data-exchnage/) to the [Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net). 
4. Present a 5 minute presentation on Thursday of your findings to the class. 
5. Post a link to your presentation and Riverscapes Studio Project in the [Riverscapes Consortium Community](https://www.riverscapes.net/topics/45485/feed).

## In Class Exercises

### Data for Exercises
:::tip
You are welcome to download these projects as we use them in class, or download them all ahead of time. We suggest downloading them somewhere easy to navigate to (and making a favorite shortcut to that folder in QGIS) such as `c:/0_RS/CEWA6628/`. 

Also, the cards below generally link to collections of Riverscape Studio Projects in the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net) with two or more projects. There tends to be larger projects with all the base imagery, and smaller projects without. For most exercises, you only need the smaller "exercise" projects. The "final" projects are provided for reference.

| Project Indicator Template |  [ Condition Worksheet.xlsx](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/etalweb.joewheaton.org/Courses/WATS5350/Lowtech/birch/Condition+Worksheet.xlsx) | This is an excel template worksheet for populating active channel, active floodplain, vs. inaccessed floodplain mapping of your valley bottom as a means of cataloging condition and estimating recovery potential and constraining design. To the extent possible, you will be using QRiS [Analyses](#analyses) to populate these tables (one for every sample frame or reach).|

#### Overview of Project Indicator Template
This 7 minute video gives an over of the condition worksheet (from [Capstone class](https://capstone.restoration.usu.edu/Course_Topics/WATS_5350/Low-Tech/Projects/birch/birchplanning.html#cpp---planning-resources) and different example project).

:::tip
Warning, most people grasp the idea of choosing the rows for this table (i.e. metrics and indicators) fairly quickly. They then realize that planning is essentially three columns of this table: existing conditions, estimated historic (for reference) and estimated future conditions (i.e. recovery potential). Most tend to grasp the concept of recovery potential being limited by estimated histroic too. **What confuses people most is how many tables they will end up with.** You have a separate table for every [sample frame](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/inputs/sample-frames) or [area of interest](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/inputs/aoi/) you choose as the spatial extent of your [analysis](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/analyses). 

Some think, all I need is one table for my entire property or project area. This may be simple and fine in some cases, but it often makes it difficult to differenatiate important spatial differences in condition and recovery potential across the project area. This is why we often have multiple sample frames.

### 4. Introduction to using QRiS - Example of Birch Creek

Here, we will pick up the same Birch Creek project from Exercise 1, but work more slowly through a LTPBR story and the specific steps so you can start to learn how we **can** do riverscape health monitoring for an action-effectiveness LTPBR monitoring example.

Of course the real stories of Brich Creek our best told by [Jay Wilde](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/resources/casestudies/birch/#jays-story---the-longer-version), [Ben Goldfarb](https://www.bengoldfarb.com/) (author of "[Eager](https://www.amazon.com/Eager-Surprising-Secret-Beavers-Matter/dp/160358739X)") and a slough of [documentary film makers, reporters and interviewers](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/resources/casestudies/birch/#story-told-by-others). 




#### A. Birch Creek Demo and Project Overview (Exercise 2- the story in QRiS format)

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="O8EBndTgk9M" />



#### B. Birch Creek Exercise 3 (RIM DCE)

1. Open the project you created in Exercise 1.
2. Right click on the previously created DCE and select `Properties`.
3. Make sure the `Show Experimental Protocols` box is checked in `[Settings](https://qris.riverscapes.net/software-help/toolbar/#settings)` .
4. Browse in available layers to the LTPBR protocol and selct the Inudation Extents layer and click Add. Scroll to the River Inundation Mapping protocol and select the Dam Crests layer and click Add. Click OK.
5. Individually digitize those two layers.
6. Right click on your previously created analysis and click Properties. 
7. Find the metrics related to ponded, overflow, and free flowing inundation types and change them from None to Metric and click OK.
8. Right click the analyis again and select Open Analysis. 
9. Now you can select Calculate and redo the calculation to calculate the metrics associated with the new layers you just digitized.

### 5.Concept of Protocols in QRiS

[Protocols](/technical-reference/protocols/) can help you and your organization unlock the power of data capture and analysis with QGIS Riverscapes Studio (QRiS).

QRiS provides a flexible and consistent framework for digitizing and managing riverscape data. QRiS is built to help with riverscape analysis, monitoring, assessment, LTPBR design preparation, and capturing as-built LTPBR designs.

### 6. LTPBR V2 Protocol Overview
The first protocol that was built into QRiS was the Weber et al. (2024) **Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration Design and Monitoring Protocol: Standard Methods for Developing Project Designs and Assessing Riverscape Health. Version 2.0.** or LTPBR V2 Protocol. This protocol contains a suite of layers for mapping riverscape features important to LTPBR design and monitoring. **It is not the only way to monitoring riverscape health!*. There are many other protocols available in QRiS including the [Riverscape Inundation Mapping Protocol](/technical-reference/protocols/protocol-library/dce-protocols/riverscape-inundation-mapping-rim-protocol) and others that may be more appropriate for your monitoring needs. However, the LTPBR V2 protocol is a good starting point for learning how to monitor riverscape health in QRiS. There is a difference between the ["protocol" as it exists in QRiS](https://qris.riverscapes.net/technical-reference/protocols/protocol-library/dce-protocols/ltpbr-dce-protocol) and the published [protocol document](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13769899).
