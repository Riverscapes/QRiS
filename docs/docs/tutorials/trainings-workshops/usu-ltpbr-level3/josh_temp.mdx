## Birch Creek Exercise 1 (new project, digitize dams, SF, analysis)

1. Click on QRIS logo and select Project > '+ New QRIS Project'. Give it a name and save location and click ok.
2. Right click on Data Capture Events node and select '+ Add New Data Capture Event'. In the dialog box that pops up do the following:
    1. Give the DCE a name 
    2. Make sure the box next to SHow Experimental Protocols is checked. 
    3. In Available Layers locate the Beaver Protocol and select the Beaver Dam Survey layer and click Add.
    4. Click OK.
3. Right click the Beaver Dam Survey layer and select add to map.
4. Begin an edit session and start digitizing dam locations and fill out the form that pops up for each poin to add information about the dam at each digitized location. When finished save the edits.
5. Right click on the Riverscapes node and select 'Create New (manually digitized) Valley Bottom'. Add that layer to the map and begin an edit session and digitize a Valley Bottom that encompasses all the dams you previously digitized.
6. Right click on the Analyses node and select '+ Add New Anlysis'. Give it a name, select your previously digitized valley Bottom as the Analysis Mask. Set all metrics and indicators to None using the button in the bottom right. Then find the Total Dam Count metric and change it from none to Metric. Click Ok to open the analysis form.
7. Click Calculate and leave the defaults in the pop up window and click ok to calculate dam cout within your valley bottom that was used as the sample frame.

## Birch Creek Exercise 3 (RIM DCE)

1. Open the project you created in Exercise 1.
2. Right click on the previously created DCE and select Properties.
3. Make sure the Show Experimental Protocols box is checked.
4. Browse in available layers to the LTPBR protocol and selct the Inudation Extents layer and click Add. Scroll to the River Inundation Mapping protocol and select the Dam Crests layer and click Add. Click OK.
5. Individually digitize those two layers.
6. Right click on your previously created analysis and click Properties. 
7. Find the metrics related to ponded, overflow, and free flowing inundation types and change them from None to Metric and click OK.
8. Right click the analyis again and select Open Analysis. 
9. Now you can select Calculate and redo the calculation to calculate the metrics associated with the new layers you just digitized.
