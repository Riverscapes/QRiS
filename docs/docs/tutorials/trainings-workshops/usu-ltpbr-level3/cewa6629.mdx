### Overview to CEWA/WATS 6629
This is the main resource page for the [CEWA/WATS 6629](ttps://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/WATS-6629/) - *Screening & Prioritization of Riverscape Restoration* course offered
through [Utah State University](https://qanr.usu.edu/wats/restoration/). This course is part of an [advanced series](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/) of courses
on Low Tech Process Based Restoration (LTPBR) offered through USU and the [Riverscapes Consortium](https://riverscapes.net). The course is designed to provide experience using remotely sensed data
and geospatial [models](https://tools.riverscapes.net) to assess potential restoration opportunities and prioritize them when necessary. This course compliments the [Introduction to LTPBR Design](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/WATS-5623/) in the Intro to LTPBR Spring Series and most directly follows on to concepts in the [Advanced LTPBR Planning (CEWA/WATS 6626)](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/WATS-6626) course.

> **Description:** Students will learn how to obtain and analyze geospatial model outputs to assess potential opportunities for LTPBR efforts across large spatial extents. They will then use the workflows
to select and prioritize potential restoration sites in landscapes they are working or care about.

## Prerequisites and Preparing for Class
### Background or Catch-Up Reading


### Software Requirements
- Install QGiS and the [QRiS](https://qris.riverscapes.net/download) and [Riverscapes Viewer](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/Deploy/install-qgis/) Plugins (see [here](https://qris.riverscapes.net/download)).
- (Optional) Install [SQLite Studio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) to perform SQL queries on model outputs in a non-geospatial environment.

:::warning
If you did not take the [planning course](/tutorials/trainings-workshops/usu-ltpbr-level3/cewa6626), please review the [software installation instructions](/tutorials/trainings-workshops/usu-ltpbr-level3/cewa6626#a-install-and-open-project) and ensure you have QGiS, the QRiS plugin, and the Riverscapes Viewer plugin installed and working before the first day of class. If you need help with this, please show up on Monday morning at 8:45 AM instead of 9:00 AM.
