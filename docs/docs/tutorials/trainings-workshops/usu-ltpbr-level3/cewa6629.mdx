### Overview to CEWA/WATS 6629
This is the main resource page for the [CEWA/WATS 6629](ttps://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/WATS-6629/) - *Screening & Prioritization of Riverscape Restoration* course offered
through [Utah State University](https://qanr.usu.edu/wats/restoration/). This course is part of an [advanced series](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/) of courses
on Low Tech Process Based Restoration (LTPBR) offered through USU and the [Riverscapes Consortium](https://riverscapes.net). The course is designed to provide experience using remotely sensed data
and geospatial [models](https://tools.riverscapes.net) to assess potential restoration opportunities and prioritize them when necessary. This course compliments the [Introduction to LTPBR Design](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/WATS-5623/) in the Intro to LTPBR Spring Series and most directly follows on to concepts in the [Advanced LTPBR Planning (CEWA/WATS 6626)](https://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/workshops/2025/USU/Advanced/WATS-6626) course.

> **Description:** Students will learn how to obtain and analyze geospatial model outputs to assess potential opportunities for LTPBR efforts across large spatial extents. They will then use the workflows
to select and prioritize potential restoration sites in landscapes they are working or care about.

## Prerequisites and Preparing for Class
### Background or Catch-Up Reading


### Software Requirements
- Install QGiS and the [QRiS](https://qris.riverscapes.net/download) and [Riverscapes Viewer](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/Deploy/install-qgis/) Plugins (see [here](https://qris.riverscapes.net/download)).
- (Optional) Install [SQLite Studio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) to perform SQL queries on model outputs in a non-geospatial environment.

:::warning
If you did not take the [planning course](/tutorials/trainings-workshops/usu-ltpbr-level3/cewa6626), please review the [software installation instructions](/tutorials/trainings-workshops/usu-ltpbr-level3/cewa6626#a-install-and-open-project) and ensure you have QGiS, the QRiS plugin, and the Riverscapes Viewer plugin installed and working before the first day of class. If you need help with this, please show up on Monday morning at 8:45 AM instead of 9:00 AM.

## Main Assignment
The main outcome of this workshop is to come up with a **prioritized list of potential restoration sites** within a geography with a minimum size, with appropriate conextual justification for the decisions.

### Data for Exercises
:::tip
You are welcome to download these projects as we use them in class, or download them all ahead of time. We suggest downloading them somewhere easy to navigate to (and making a favorite shortcut to that folder in QGIS) such as `c:/0_RS/CEWA6629/`.

### 2. Riverscapes Network Models

#### a. Download and Open a Riverscapes Project

1. Go to the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net). If you haven't already, you will be prompted to create a login. You can create a new login, or link your account to your Google or Apple login. The home screen contains various cards to help navigate the Data Exchange. 'Explore, Search, Find' helps you find projects, organizations, and people. 'My Organizations' shows the Data Exchange organizations that you are a member of. 'My Bookmarked Items' shows items that you have bookmarked to return to later. 'Project Types' shows the main model types housed in the exchange with links to browse those specific model types.
2. Click on the 'Expore our Project Map' button in the 'Explore, Search, Find' card. This will open a web map that can be used to navigate to find projects.
3. At the top, there is a dropdown menu that allows you to filter by project type. Choose a project type you are interested in (from the Riverscapes Network Models types) and set the filter. 
4. Either manually zoom to an area you are interested in, or use the embedded search ('Find a place') in the map and type in a place (e.g., a city name). Once you are zoomed in to a certain level, you will see polygon outlines of project boundaries. 
5. Click inside of a project extent - this will pin a card showing the available projects of the selected type, for that extent. (If you hover over the small project extent polygon there are two buttons: one to zoom to the extent of the polygon, and one to filter your selection to projects with that extent.) Click on a specific project to go to the project page. A new page will open with the project name as the header. There are several tabs on the page, with the 'overview' tab selected by default. Click through the other tabs to explore the information the page contains.
6. On the top right (to the right of the project name) are several buttons: the 'bookmark' button, which allows you to bookmark the project to come back to later from your home landing page, the 'download' button to download the project to your local machine, the 'share' button share the link to the project, the 'open map viewer' button, which opens the project in the Data Exchange's integrated web GIS, and the 'copy project to clipboard' button. Click on the 'open map viewer' (globe button) to open the project in the web GIS.
7. In the web GIS, there is a project tree on the left side, which shows the structure of the project and the data layers in the project. The right side has a layers table of contents. Layers are added by double clicking them in the project tree, or right clicking them and choosing 'Add to Map'. Layers are removed by clicking the 'X' beside them in the table of contents. At the top of the layers panel is a 'Curated Views' dropdown. Curated views are combinations of coherent layers that are added to the map together. Bring layers into the map (and remove them) using both the project tree as well as the curated views to explore the layers that are contained in the project. Note that there is an 'identify features' button on the bottom left of the map. This button allows you to view the attributes of any feature of a feature class that you have open in the map.
:::info
While we actively maintain the curation of these projects (project structure and layer symbology), occasionally changes/updates cause issues. If a layer is not showing up when you pull it into the map the symbology likely needs updated. If you wish to file an issue for the team to respond to, you can do so in [GitHub](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RiverscapesXML/issues) (requires a GitHub account), or our [Help Desk](https://riverscapes.freshdesk.com/support/home)(does not require an account).
:::
8. The top left part of the screen has a project card. On the bottom right of the card is another 'download' button. Click the button to download a zip file of the project to your local machine (in the directory you created to easily access data for this course), and extract the zipped folder.
9. Open QGIS. You should have the [Riverscapes Viewer](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/) plugin installed. If you do not see the instructions [here](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/Deploy/install-qgis/). Click on the 'Riverscapes Viewer' button, then choose 'Open Riverscapes Project'. Navigate to the project folder that you downloaded. Inside the folder is a file called 'project.rs.xml'. This is the file that you select to open the project in QGIS.
:::tip
For more info on the functionality of the Viewer, see the [documenation](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/software-help/help-qgis)
:::
10. Similar to the web viewer, a panel opens with a project tree, from which layers can be added to the map. Like the web viewer, projects can simply be viewed using the 'prebaked' symbology in the viewer. However, now you are operating in a fully functional GIS environment, and can acually perform spatial analysis on the data within the projects. 

### 3. Riverscape Inventory
