These [example datasets](https://data.riverscapes.net/d/6ace10a9-c762-4114-9229-49a61681d04b/) were curated to show users examples of different projects that have been tracked over time in QRIS. Clicking on each dataset example will redirect you to the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](data.riverscapes.net) to a collection that includes two different projects. One with imagery and one without. The version without imagery is included to reduce download size, but will be lacking the context that imagery provides to each data capture event. Links to the projects in [PBR Explorer](pbr.riverscapes.net) as well as any youtube videos of the project area can be found in the metadata of each collection.

## Consuming Riverscapes Studio Projects

Riverscapes Studio Projects can be consumed in a few different ways. 
1. First, they can be viewed in any of our [Riverscapes Viewers](https://riverscapes.net/viewers) (web browser on [Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net), or in ArcPro or QGIS). When consumed through the viewer, they are only viewable. 
2. They can also be opened as QRiS projects with the QRiS plugin in QGIS. This allows you to actually edit and add to the project. Whether you can upload changes back to the Data Exchange depends on your permissions. If you are not the owner of the project, you will not be able to upload changes back to the Data Exchange, but you can upload it as a new project of your own.
