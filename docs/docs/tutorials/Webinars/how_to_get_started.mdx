### Description

In this brief webinar we spent  30 minutes demonstrating some ways to get started in QRiS for a new site. The purpose is to give you confidence going to any riverscape, and getting started at the desktop to learn more about your riverscape.

Features of QRiS we will demonstrate include: 

Creating a New Project
- Using some context from Riverscapes Projects from [Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net/) to get oriented
- [Delineating a Watershed](/software-help/context/watershed-catchments/#creating-a-watershed-catchment) for my riverscape reach
- Finding nearby [stream gages](/software-help/context/stream-gage-explorer)
- Creating [Areas of Interest](/software-help/inputs/aoi)
- Importing [context](/software-help/context) to my QRiS project
- Importing VBET DGOs as [Sample Frames](/software-help/inputs/sample-frames)
- Performing an Analysis from [Climate Engine](/software-help/context/climate-engine-explorer#downloading-climate-engine-metrics)

:::warning
There is a known issue with Climate Engine's API being blocked by some DOI/BLM networks.
