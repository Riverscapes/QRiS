### Description
In this demonstration session, we will highlight some new BETA features of the [Riverscapes Studio](https://qris.riverscapes.net/) including:

- [Calculating Metrics](/technical-reference/metric_calculations/)
    - This will be based on the motivation of populating a [Metric or Indicator Table](https://capstone.restoration.usu.edu/Course_Topics/WATS_5350/Low-Tech/Projects/birch/birchplanning.html#2-project-objectives) for your LTPBR projects using QRiS, in which the rows are metrics, the columns are time (i.e. data capture events) and a table is produced for every "sample frame" or polygon.
-  [Updated Stream Gauge Tool](/software-help/context/stream-gage-explorer/)
-  [Climate Engine Analysis](/software-help/context/climate-engine-explorer/)

The demo will be based on QRiS v. [0.3.21](https://github.com/Riverscapes/QRiS/releases/tag/version_0.3.21). We recorded the session for those that can't make it. These tools and features are in active development. Based on user experiences and feedback, we will be making improvements to them. However, they are ready to play with and try to break (it is GIS afterall) today.  
:::note
We will assume users have some familiarity with QRiS (see [here](https://riverscapes.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/153000141260-introduction-to-riverscapes-studio-qris-for-ltpbr) for introduction) and a basic understanding of QGIS (see [here](https://riverscapes.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/folders/153000173894) for resources).
