There are lots of situations where you may not want to draw ([edit or digitize](/tutorials/getting-started/digitizing)) your data from scratch in a QRiS project for a specific feature in a data capture event. For example, maybe you did a field survey with [Survey123](/tutorials/faq/arcgis-online/qris_agol), or maybe you have some data in another feature class (e.g. a shapefile, geopackage, KMZ, etc.). You can right click on any feature class layer in a Data Capture Event in QRiS, and use the Import Features From command.

In the video below, we show an example of doing this from a temporary scratch layer. We also illustrate how to use the attribute mapper to preserve the attribute categories from the original layer, but map them on to the attribute categories used as part of the protocol in that QRiS feature class.
