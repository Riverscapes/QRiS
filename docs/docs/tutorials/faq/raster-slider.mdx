description: Demonstration of using the Raster Slider tool and temporary layers to map Geomorphic Units quicjly and efficiently

Mapping some layers like Geomporphic Units can be a big task, this demo will cover how to map mutually exclusive valley unit polygons from the Geomorphic Mapping of Riverscapes Protocol. It uses a combination of tools from QRIS as well as those found in the Processing Toolbox of QGIS. This is a common workflow for any layer but is extremely useful for this particular layer.
