The [Profile Tool](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/profiletool/) is available through the QGIS Plugin Library. It is a useful tool to create and save elevation profiles within your riverscape. It is not a part of QRIS but can easily be integrated into your QRIS workflow.

## Install
To install the plugin navigate to the **Plugins** tab at the top of your QGIS window. Click **Manage and Install Plugins**. On the left hand panel make sure **All** is selected and then search 'Profile Tool' in the search box. Select The 'Profile Tool' from the list and click **Install Plugin**. 

To access the plugin click on the logo that has now appeared in your toolbars.
