LTPBR as-builts document the final placement and types of structures constructed during a restoration project. Since many LTPBR projects are field fitted during construction, as-built structures may differ from the original specifications of the LTPBR design. 

Compared to the design interface, LTPBR as-builts contain only structure layers and include additional temporal attributes for construction & survey dates. Besides these differences, as-built surveys utilize the same constructs as LTPBR designs. 

As-Builts can be strengthened with supplemental information including contextual riverscape data (e.g., Data Exchange), high-resolution imagery, or previously completed designs and as-builts (i.e., phases). **In QRiS, as-builts can be added by right clicking on the `Data Capture Events` bin, selecting `Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration`, and clicking on `Add New As-Built Survey`**.

## As-Built Interface
Once you have created a new as-built in QRiS, you will be prompted with the following options. 

### Layers
As-Built layers are spatially represented as a point or line feature. These features and their attributes are defined by protocols stored in the protocol library (e.g., LTPBR V2). **You have the flexibility to use as many layers as needed, drawing from a single protocol or combining elements from multiple protocols.** 

### Basic Properties
Under Basic Properties, you can provide additional information about your as-built such as dates of survey & completion, project phase, and more. A detailed breakdown is provided below.  

ASSOCIATED VALLEY BOTTOM – The valley bottom polygon that defines the boundary of your as-built. This feature is linked to your as-built layers and will be rendered alongside them in the map panel.   

DESIGN THIS AS-BUILT IS BASED ON – Original design that guided construction of as-built.    

PROJECT PHASE – Implementation phase of the as-built. Many LTPBR projects consist of multiple phases to mark punctuated periods of restoration treatments. For example, *Phase 1* may describe structural treatments constructed during the first year of implementation, while *Phase 2* would refer to additional structural treatments (or maintenance) constructed in a subsequent year.  

DATE OF AS-BUILT SURVEY – Date of survey for completed as-built. Can be entered as year/month/day, year/month, or year only.  

DATE OF AS-BUILT CONSTRUCTION – Date of construction for the as-built. Can be entered as year/month/day, year/month, or year only.  

OBSERVER(S) – Person or people who surveyed as-built. 

AS-BUILT OBSERVATIONS – Describes the setting in which as-built was surveyed. 
- PREVIOUS SITE VISIT – As-built was surveyed remotely using information collected from a previous site visit to the project area.
- DESKTOP ANALYSIS (REMOTE) – As-built was surveyed on a desktop computer using GIS software (e.g., QRiS, Google Earth, etc..) and contextual data (e.g., drone imagery). 
- FIELD WORK – As-built was surveyed on-site using a mobile GIS application or other means of data capture.

### Bases for Designs

**Raster surfaces (from `Context` or `Surfaces` bins) or Data Capture Events** can be attached to provide important context for the as-built. For example, high resolution drone imagery can be used to show the exact placement of structures post-construction. Like associated valley bottoms, these come linked to your design layers and will be rendered alongside them in the map panel.   

### Description

Descriptive narrative related to the context, considerations, and constraints associated with the as-built. Descriptions may include (but not limited to) project goals & objectives, collaborating partners, construction limitations, similarities & differences between the as-built and the original design, construction methods and materials used, etc. 

### Metadata

Associated metadata with your as-built. This can include (but not limited to) website links, file & folder locations, data sources, etc. Also comes with read-only QRiS metadata populated with information from the interface.  

### Help

If users need help or assistance with LTPBR as-builts or the interface, click on the `Help` button in the lower left hand corner of the interface window. 

### Opening Layers in Map Panel

Once you have finalized the as-built components within the interface, you can add your layers to the map by clicking on the `OK` button.
