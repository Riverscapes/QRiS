*Planning Containers* are special containers used to define the baseline conditons of your riverscape from **any Data Capture Event, Design, or As-Built**. Planning Containers can be added in QRiS by right clicking on the `Data Capture Events` bin, selecting `Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration`, and clicking on `Add New Planning Container`. 

Once added, you can click on the `Add` button to select **one or multiple DCE(s), design(s), or as-built(s)** to be used as the *Historical, Contemporary, or Predicted* conditions of the riverscape.

Finally, you can add descriptive narrative or metadata associated with the Planning Container under the `Description` and `Metadata` tabs respectively.
