description: Add context to your map with basemaps
---

QRiS comes with a library of popular basemaps to help quick add context to your work. These basemaps are provided as a conveniece to the user and are subject to the availability of the service provider.

The list of available basemaps is shown at the bottom of the QRiS project tree. Expand the branches of this tree to see the available basemaps and double click on the basemap you want to add to your current map document.

Basemaps are not stored in your QRiS project file, but are downloaded from the internet when you add them to your map. This means that you need to be connected to the internet to add basemaps to your map. It also means that you need to add them to your QGIS map document each session that you are using QRiS.
