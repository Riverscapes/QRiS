Importing features classes into your empty QRIS layers can be done a number of ways. Any Input layer or DCE layer will have three different pathways to import existing data. 

## Add From Existing Feature Class

To do this, right click the desired Input folder or DCE Layer within your QRiS [project](/software-help/projects). Navigate to **Import (feature type) from** and select **+ Existing Feature Class**. Browse to the location of the feature class and click **Open**. Provide a name and optional description. You can also define key/value pairs of metadata that help describe the originof the data. Click **OK** to import and create a copy of the feature class will be added to your project.

## Add From Temporary Layer

You can also add data from a temporary layer existing in your layer tree. The layer must be turned on and visible in the layer tree for QRIS to recognize it. The process is the same as adding an existing layer, just select **+ Temporary Layer** instead. A new window will pop up to select the desired temporary layer, navigate to the correct layer and click **OK**. A new window will pop up to give it a name, description, key/value pairs of metadata (same as importing from existing data).

## Create New (Manually Digitized)

You can create a new feature class by digitizing it using QGIS editing toolbars. To do this, right the desired input folder or DCE Layer within your QRIS [project](/software-help/projects). Select the **+ Create New (Manually Digitized)** button. Provide a name and optional description and then click **OK**. You can now use the standard QGIS editing tools to digitize the AOI on the map. Remember to stop editing and save your changes before the AOI is available for use when importing other data.
