## Hiding & Showing the QRiS Toolbar

The QRiS toolbar can be hidden and shown by right clicking on the gray area to the right of the QGIS menus and toolbars. Look for QRiS under the **Toolbars** subheading. You access the same list via the View -> Toolbars menu.

## Hiding & Showing the QRiS Project Explorer

Clicking the QRiS icon on the left side of the QRiS toolbar will hide and show the QRiS Project Explorer. The explorer is used to navigate and manage your QRiS projects. You can only ever have one QRiS project open at a time.
