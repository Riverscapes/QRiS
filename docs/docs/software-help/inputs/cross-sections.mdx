Cross sections are transect lines across a riverscape. They are used to measure the elevation of the river bed and the water surface at a given point in time. 

Cross sections can also be used to subdivide a polygon into segments as a way of generating a [sample frame](/software-help/sample-frames).

## Importing Existing Cross Sections

You can import an existing polyline feature class and use it as a cross section layer. Importing existing data is covered in [Importing Features](/software-help/importing-features).

## Create New Cross Sections

Right click on the **Cross Sections** folder in the QRiS project tree and select **Create New (Manually Digitized) Cross Sections**. This will open a window where you can specify the name and description of the cross sections. You can also specify metadata key/value pairs for important information about the database. Click **OK** and the cross sections will be created and displayed in the map view. Use the built in QGIS editing capabilities to edit the cross section geometries.

## Editing Cross Section Properties

To edit the properties of a cross section, right click on the cross section in the project tree and select **Properties**. This will open a window where you can edit the name, description, and metadata of the cross section. You can also add the cross sections to the map and use the built in QGIS editing capabilities to edit the cross section geometries.

## Generate a Sample Frame

This a tool accessed by right clicking on the profile and selecting **Generate Sample Frames**. Info on how to use the tool in [Sample Frames](/Software-help/inputs/sample-frames/)

## Deleting Cross Sections

To delete a cross section, right click on the cross section in the project tree and select **Delete**. This will remove the cross section from the project.
