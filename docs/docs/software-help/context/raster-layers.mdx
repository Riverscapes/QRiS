It can be hard to anticipate all the types of map layers that are useful for a particular riverscape. QRiS allows you to import your own raster layers to add context to your map. For example, you may have a vegetation raster, administrative boundary dataset etc that is useful for context, but doesn't perfectly fit one of other types of rasters that QRiS supports as [surfaces](/software-help/surfaces).

QRiS makes a copy of the raster layer within the project folder structure.

## Importing Raster Layers

right click on the **Context** folder within the QRiS project tree and choose **Import Existing Context Raster**. This will open a file browser window. Navigate to the raster layer you wish to import and click **Open**. A copy of the raster layer will be imported into the project and added to the map.

## Edit Raster Properties

You can edit the properties of a raster layer by right clicking on the layer in the project tree and choosing **Properties**. This will open a window where you can edit the name and description.

## Raster Slider

You can use the Raster Slider from [Surfaces](/software-help/Inputs/surfaces) here as well. Visit that page for help with this tool.

## Delete Raster Layers

You can delete a raster layer by right clicking on the layer in the project tree and choosing **Delete**. This will remove the layer from the project and delete the raster file from the project folder structure.
