QRiS projects can include several different types of layers for contextualizing your riveerscape. These include generic vector layers that you digitize yourself or import from other sources. These appear directly under the Context node in the project tree. Then there are dedicated items for stream gages, delineating watershed catchments and exploring Climate Engine variables.
