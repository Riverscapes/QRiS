Data from Riverscapes projects can be directly imported to QRIS through the Riverscapes Viewer. This allows users to store a portion of a Riverscapes Project within their QRIS project. This is an easy way to get started on a project with relavant contextual data. 

## Downloading a Riverscapes Project

Projects can be downloaded from the [Riverscapes Data Exchange](https://data.riverscapes.net/). A brief overview can be found [here](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/about/)

## Opening a Riverscapes Project

Information on Riverscapes Projects for QGIS can be found [here](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/software-help/help-qgis/).

## Importing Data from Riverscapes Viewer to QRIS Project

After opening a Rivercspapes Project you will a see the default layers of that project brought into your map as well as a new indow to navigate the riverscapes project.

Simultaneously open your QRIS Project so that you have a Riverscapes Viewer window as well as the QRIS plugin window open/visible.

Now you can browse the folders in the Riverscapes Viewer to find the layer you would like to add to your QRIS project. Right-clicking on any layer will open a pop up with the ability to click **Add to QRIS**. A new window will pop up with the following import options:

- **Name** - The name you would like the imported layer to have (default comes from layer name in Riverscapes Viewer).
- **Source Path** - the actual file path the data is coming from.
- **Context Layer Type** - Only current option is Other.
- **Project Path** - the new path the file will be stored in the QRIS project.
- **Clip to AOI** - a dropdown showing all AOIs in project. If you select one the imported data will be clipped to those extents. 
- **Description** - optional description of the layer.

A metadata tab also exists. Metadata from the project is copied over but additonal key/value pairs can be added if desired. 

Clicking **OK** will add the layer to your QRIS project. All layers imported this way are added to the Context folder.
