Riverscapes Valley Bottoms are a key component of developing a LTPBR restoration project. They provide the spatial context for the restoration project and represent the theoretical physical space for restoration to occur.

You can have as many Valley Bottoms within your project as you like.

## Add an Existing Valley Bottom

You can import an existing valley bottom polygon feature class or temporary map layer into QRiS. To do this, click the **Import Existing Valley Bottom From...** menu item on the **Riverscapes** Node within your QRiS [project](/software-help/projects). Select the temporary map layer, or browse to the location of the polygon feature class and click **Open**. Provide a name and optional description for the Valley Bottom. You can also define key/value pairs of metadata that help describe the origin of the data. Click **OK** to import and create a copy of the feature class will be added to your project..

A common workflow is to import a VBET valley bottom into QRiS. 

## Create a New Valley Bottom

You can create a new valley bottom by manually drawing a polygon on the map. To do this, click the **Create New (Manually Digitized) Valley Bottom** menu item on the **Riverscapes** node within your QRiS [project](/software-help/projects). Provide a name and optional description and then click **OK**. Add the Valley Bottom layer to the map by clicking the **Add to Map** button. You can now use the standard QGIS editing tools to digitize the valley bottom on the map. Remember to stop editing and save your changes to the valley bottom feature.

## Add a Valley Bottom to the Map

You can add an Valley Bottom to the map by right-clicking on any individual Valley Bottom under the **Riverscapes** node in the QRiS project tree and selecting **Add to Map**. This will add the Valley Bottom to the map as a new layer. 

## Edit a Valley Bottom

You can edit a Valley Bottom's properties by right-clicking on any individual Valley Bottom under the **Riverscapes** node in the QRiS project tree and selecting **Edit**. This will open the Valley Bottom properties and allow you to edit the Valley Bottom name, description and/or metadata.

## Delete a Valley Bottom

You can delete a Valley Bottom by right clicking on any individual Valley Bottom under the **Riverscapes** node in the QRiS project tree and selecting **Delete**. This will remove the Valley Bottom from the QRiS project.
