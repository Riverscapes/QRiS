## QGIS Installation

To install QRiS, you'll first need to set up [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), a free and open-source Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software. QRiS functions as a [QGIS Plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/), meaning it relies on QGIS to run.

:::note
There are lots of resources on QGIS if you are new to GIS or QGIS. We have some Knowledge Base articles and tutorials available [here](https://riverscapes.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/folders/153000173894) to help you get started.
:::

QGIS is compatible with a variety of operating systems, including **Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android**. When choosing a QGIS version, you'll see two main types: **Experimental (latest) Releases and Long Term Releases (LTR)**. LTR versions are generally more stable, while Experimental Releases offer the latest features.

:::warning
**QRiS is designed to work with the latest QGIS LTR**, so be sure to install that version (found [here](https://qgis.org/download/)). If a specific QGIS version is required for a particular QRiS release, this information will be provided in the [release notes](https://github.com/Riverscapes/QRiS/releases) or as a pop-up within the QGIS Plugin Manager.

## How to Install QRiS

QRiS can be installed from the QGIS Plugin Manager. However, you must have the latest version of [Riverscapes Viewer installed](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/Deploy/install-qgis#plugin-installation) before installing QRiS. To install QRiS, follow these steps: 

  1. **First, verify installation or install the Riverscapes Viewer Plugin**:

      - In the QGIS menubar (top of page), go to `Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins`. 

      - Search for *Riverscapes Viewer* and click the *Install* button (should take less than 30 seconds). This is a required dependency for QRiS.

  2. **Then, install QRiS**:

      - Go to the same `Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins` and search for *QRiS*.

      - Click the *Install* button (should take less than 30 seconds).

## Updating QRiS

You can update QRiS at any time after installation through the **QGIS Plugin Manager**. Here's how:

  1. Go to `Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins`.

  2. Select **QRiS** from the list of installed plugins.

  3. Click the ***Update* button**.

For automatic updates, you can configure the Plugin Manager settings to `Check for Updates on Startup`. When enabled:

- QGIS will notify you periodically (every 3 days) upon startup if any installed plugin, including QRiS, has an available update.

- To apply the update, simply click the ***Update* button** that appears on the blue taskbar in the map panel.

:::tip
**Tip:** To ensure you always have the latest features and improvements, regularly check for updates to QRiS and its dependencies. At the same time you update QRiS, it is a good idea to also [update resources](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/Deploy/install-qgis#updating-resources) in the Riverscapes Viewer. This is where updates to symblogogy and updates to the [Protocol Library](technical-reference/protocol-library).

## Installing Older Versions of QRiS

If you need to install an older version of QRiS, you can do so by downloading the specific version from the [QRiS GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Riverscapes/QRiS/releases).

Once the version is dowloaded locally onto your device, you can install the plugin in QGIS by going to `Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins > Install from ZIP` and selecting the ZIP file.
