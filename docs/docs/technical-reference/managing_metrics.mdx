## Introduction
A QRiS Metric is a value representing a property of an associated Design, As-Built or Data Capture Event within a Sample Frame polygon. Metric values can be manually entered or derived from a simple calculation using one or more DCE layers, with or without additional input layers, such as DEMs, valley centerlines, etc. Uncertainty values can also be stored with manually entered metric values.

QRiS Metric definitions are stored within each QRiS Project geopackage. New metrics can be defined within a json definition file and imported into a project. Existing metrics can be edited or deleted.

## Viewing Metrics
The current list of metrics stored within a QRiS Project can be viewed under Help/Settings and navigating to the Metrics tab. The Metrics tab displays a list of all metrics defined within the project, including the metric name, description, calculation function, metric paramaters, and other metadata. 

## Exporting Metrics to JSON Files
Each metric in the list can be exported to a JSON file by clicking the `Export` button and selecting a location to save the file. The JSON file contains all the information needed to recreate the metric in another QRiS Project or allow for editing and re-importing back into the same project. (see [Metric JSON Schema](#metric-json-schema))

## Creating New Metrics
New metrics can be created by defining a new metric in a JSON file and importing it into a QRiS Project. The JSON file must follow the [Metric JSON Schema](#metric-json-schema).

New metrics must have a unique `machine_name`, otherwise the import will overwrite an existing metric with the same `machine_name`.

1. Create a new metric definition in a JSON file. It is recommended to export an existing metric and use it as a template for the new metric. The JSON file can be created in a text editor or using a JSON editor such as VS Code.
2. Import the new metric into the QRiS Project by clicking the `Import` button and selecting the JSON file to import. The import process will validate the JSON file and add the metric to the metric table. If the metric already exists in the project, the import will overwrite the existing metric with the same `machine_name`.
3. Review the metric table to ensure the new metric is present and correct.
4. When you have reviewed the metric table, click the `Save` button to save the changes to the project geopackage. The geopackage will not be updated unless the `Save` button is clicked.

## Editing Existing Metrics
Metrics can be edited within a QRiS Project. The metric definition can be edited, including the metric name, description, calculation function, metric parameters, and other metadata.

1. Export the metric to a JSON file by clicking the `Export` button next to the metric you wish to edit. Save the JSON file to a location on your computer.
2. Open the JSON file in a text editor and make the desired changes to the metric definition. It is recommended to use VS Code or another JSON editor to ensure the JSON is valid and passes the schema validation.
3. Save the changes to the JSON file.
4. Import the edited metric back into the QRiS Project by clicking the `Import` button and selecting the edited JSON file. The import process will validate the JSON file and update the metric in the metric table. If the metric already exists in the project, the import will overwrite the existing metric with the same `machine_name`.
5. Review the metric table to ensure the edited metric is present and correct.
6. When you have reviewed the metric table, click the `Save` button to save the changes to the project geopackage. The geopackage will not be updated unless the `Save` button is clicked.

## Deleting Metrics
*not yet implemented in QRiS version 0.3.14*
Metrics can be deleted from a project, however this action is not reversible. Deleting a metric will remove all metric values associated with the metric from the project geopackage.

1. Click the `Delete` button next to the metric you wish to delete. This button is located on the right side of the metric table (you may need to scroll to the right to see it).
2. A confirmation dialog will appear asking you to confirm the deletion. Click `Yes` to delete the metric or `No` to cancel the deletion.
3. If you click `Yes`, the metric will be removed from the project geopackage and the metric table will be updated to reflect the change. **The geopackage will be updated immediately and the deletion cannot be undone.**

## Importing Metrics
New and edited metrics can be imported into a QRiS Project:

1. Clicking the `Import` button and select the JSON file to import. The import process will validate the JSON file and add the metric to the metric table. If the metric already exists in the project, the import will overwrite the existing metric with the same `machine_name`.
2. Review the metric table to ensure the new metric is present and correct.
3. When you have reviewed the metric table, click the `Save` button to save the changes to the project geopackage. The geopackage will not be updated unless the `Save` button is clicked.

### Layer

Layers refer to DCE layers that are used in the metric calculation. Each layer must have a `layer_name` and can have additional parameters such as `usage`, `count_field`, and `attribute_filter`.

| Field Name       | Description                                                                                   |

### Surfaces

Surfaces are raster datasets that can be used in the metric calculation. Each surface must have a `surface_name` which refers to the name of the [analysis parameter](#analysis-parameters) of the surface. The user will specify the actual raster to use for the analysis parameter when creating the analysis.

| Field Name | Description                                                                                   |

### Analysis Parameters

Analysis parameters are non-dce layers and rasters that can be used in the metric calculation. The user will specify the layer or surface to use for each analysis parameter when creating the analyis. 

| Analysis Parameter | Description                                                                                   |
