## Protocol XML
Each Protocol is be defined by a separate XML file. Protocols that ship with QRiS reside in the [RiverscapesXML repository](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RiverscapesXML). An [`protocol.xsd`](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RiverscapesXML/blob/master/QRiS/protocol.xsd) “rule file” defines the schema for these XML files and a GitHub “action” used to ensure that only protocols that validate against this rule file are be permitted into the git repository. 

A single protocol XML file contains both the layer and metric definitions. This is required for referential integrity, because the metrics refer to the layers within the protocol. Indeed metrics will only be able to refer to metrics within the protocol in which the metric is defined. In other words, an LTPBR metric cannot refer to an LCT layer.  

### Authoring and Editing Protocols
Protocols can also be developed and deployed locally by placing the protocol XML in the root of the directory of the current QRiS project.
:::tip
QRiS looks for protocol XML files in the following locations: 
- i) in the `%AppDta%\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins\riverscapes_viewer\resources\QRiS\protocols` (ships with Riverscapes Viewer and is updated automatically by syncing to  [RiverscapesXML repository](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RiverscapesXML);  
- ii)  adjacent to the current QRiS project; and 
- iii) in a user-specified local protocols folder from `Help` → `Settings` and adjusting the `Local Custom Protocols Folder` with `...`. 

These second and third options allows  protocol authors to experiment with draft protocols, similar to how [local business logic files](https://viewer.riverscapes.net/technical-reference/business-logic#customizing-business-logic--refreshing-the-project-explorer) work for Riverscapes Viewer.
:::

There is no user interface for writing protocols. Users are advised to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with linting based on the latest version of the protocol XSD rule file. 

### Protocol Versioning
QRiS protocols can be changed at any time. Any change to a protocol must increment its version number. Protocol owners have the option of either changing an existing protocol or splitting it into a new XML file:

Changing an existing protocol XML file will overwrite the previous version. This is useful for fixing any inadvertent errors in a protocol definition. Any QRiS users will receive the upgraded version and will no longer be able to create DCE layers based on the previous version. 

:::warning
Any existing layers and data will always be locked at the version of the protocol with which it was created.
:::

Creating a new file for the same protocol makes available the possibility of maintaining two active versions of the same protocol. We do not currently foresee a practical use for this, but suspect that it might be useful in the future.

### Decoupling Specification From Implementation
One of the most important concepts is the decoupling of the protocol specification (XML file) and the DCE layers that are created using the specification. Once a DCE layer is created, the definition is loaded into the QRiS project and its overall design should be considered immutable, with the exception of a few display/labeling attributes (see specification). After the DCE layer has been created, the protocol can change or get deprecated, the design of layers can evolve, but the DCE layer instance remains in the project as it was originally created. QRiS will never attempt to update the fundamental design of DCE layers (fields, field types etc) to reflect the latest version of a protocol. DCE layers reflect a snapshot of the protocol at the point in time when they were created.

**Example Scenario**

User adds Layer DAM CRESTS from Protocol A to a DCE. User digitizes features based on this specification.
Protocol A is updated (new version number) to include a new field in Layer DAM CRESTS. QRiS will not update the DAM CRESTS layer in that user’s project. User will be unable to add new DAM CRESTS layer (with new field) to their project unless the existing DAM CRESTS layer is removed. User could export to temporary layer, delete existing DAM CRESTS layer, Add the updated DAM CRESTS layer to the project and use Import Tool to add exported features into new DAM CRESTS layer. The user can, however, add the new DAM CRESTS layer to a different DCE and it will have the latest layer specification.
Protocol A is modified (version remains the same?) by changing the label for layer DAM CRESTS to BEAVER DAM CRESTS. Once this Protocol XML is synced to the user’s resources, this layer label will get updated the next time the user opens the project.
Protocol B has just been released, and includes its own version of a BEAVER DAM CRESTS layer. The user may also add this BEAVER DAM CRESTS layer to their DCE (i.e. this new protocol contains a layer with the same name as the original protocol. The two layers are distinct and can live alongside each other in the same DCE).
At any time, a protocol author can delete a protocol, or make it “deprecated”. The protocol and it’s layers will not show up in the DCE layer picker, but any existing DCE layers that used the protocol will persist and never be altered.

## Publishing and Sharing Protocols
Anyone can author a protocol by creating or editing a protocol XML file and submitting it for review as a pull request to the Riverscapes XML repository. The Riverscapes Consortium development team will get pull request notifications and action them in a timely manner.

QViewer (a prerequisite to running QRiS) synchronizes resources (symbology, business logic and protocols) daily or upon request by the user. QRiS will always read the latest protocol XML files currently residing on the local computer whenever the user wants to add a layer to a data capture event.

:::note
All protocols published to Riverscapes XML are public. Organizations will not be able to keep a protocol private.
:::

QRiS also has the option of reading protocol XML files from a local directory specified in the QRiS settings. This allows users to experiment with protocols that are not yet published to Riverscapes XML or share protocols within their organization.

## Protocol XML Schema

### Protocol
- `Protocol` (required) The root element of the protocol XML file.
  - Attributes
    - `machine_code` (required) A unique machine code identifier for the protocol. This is used to identify the protocol in the QRiS project database.
    - `version` (required) A version number for the protocol. This must be incremented whenever the protocol is changed. 
    - `status` (required) The status of the protocol, which can be one of the following:
      - _production_ - representing active protocols whose layers are available in QRiS
      - _experimental_ - hidden by default in QRiS. Developers can check a box to see experimental protocols (and use them for development or testing, similar to experimental plugins in QGIS)
      - _deprecated_ - never shown in QRiS. This will allow the protocol XML file to persist in GitHub, but its contents (layers and metrics) will not be visible to users when they are creating DCE layers.

## Protocol Documentation
The [QRiS Development Team](https://qris.riverscapes.net/About#development-team) will not approve a pull-request for a new protocol to deploy with QRiS without appropriate documentation. In addition to submitting a pull request to the [RiverscapesXML repository](https://github.com/Riverscapes/RiverscapesXML), a pull request for a `*.mdx` protocol page to be found under the [QRiS Protocol Library](https://qris.riverscapes.net/protocols/protocol-library) part of this website.  

Best practices include:
1. Authoring a complete protocol documentation page on what is in the protocol and how to implement it with sections (as *.mdx - see here for how; easiest to copy an existing one as a template):
  - Overview
  - Protocol Summary table, including citaeable citation
  - Layers & Metrics
    - Video Demonstration
    - Layer Attributes
    - Metric Attributes
2. Authoring an external report (PDF) and/or peer-reviewed publication that describes and/or vetts the methods and the *why* behind the *what* and *how*. If protocol document is a self-published document, we recommend [uploading to Zeondo](https://docs.riverscapes.net/get-involved/documentation/WebSites/Common/#add-a-doi-with-zenodo-for-your-website-or-tool) or ResearchGate for generation of a DOI and making it publicly available and the citations trackable.
