:::warning[Warning: Experimental Protocol]

This protocol is experimental and has not been finalized by the protocol owner. It can be changed at anytime which can break existing data or cause data loss. Please backup data if using this protocol.

## Overview 

The *Anabranch Design Protocol* is the standardized protocol for conceptual restoration designs at Anabranch Solutions. 

- **Proposed restoration structures**, their spatial distribution, and anticipated geomorphic & hydraulic changes to the riverscape. 
- **Complex objectives** to identify overarching objectives for groups of structures.
- **Riverscape features** that may influence design decisions or project logistics.
- **Metrics** to support permit applications and inform landowners of potential project outcomes.

Users can create multiple designs to represent different phases of a project or to show various potential outcomes. For example, a user may create a Phase 1 design that includes structures implemented in the first year of a project and a Phase 2 design that includes structures implemented in the second year of a project. Or, a user may create mulitple design alternatives and generate a series of metrics used to inform management desicions.

*PALS - Bank Attached*|Wood Accumulation|PALS that are attached to the margin (bank) of the active channel. Generally intended to direct flow away from the attached bank and potentially encouraging bar formation and lateral erosion and/or migration of the active channel.
*PALS - Bank Blaster*|Wood Accumulation|PALS that are oriented to direct flow into a bank to enhance rates and magnitudes of bank erosion.
*PALS - Channel Spanning*|Wood Accumulation|PALS build with sufficient material to span an active channel. Generally intended to enhance channel aggradation rates and/or encourage floodplain connectivity.

*Spreaders*|Zeedyk Structure|A rock-lined depositional area designed to disperse channelized flow and restore sheet flow.
*Strategic Felling*|Wood Accumulation|Felling of trees into the channel or floodplain.
*Tight PALS (BDA without sod)*|Wood Accumulation|A channel spanning PALS built of small woody material. Similar but more porous than a typical BDA.
*Tree Dam*|Wood Accumulation|A fell tree intended to act as a channel spanning dam, may have additional vegetative material, sediment, or sod additions to further decrease porosity.
