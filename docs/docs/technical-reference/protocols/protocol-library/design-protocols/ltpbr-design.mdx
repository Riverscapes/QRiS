title: LTPBR V2 Design Protocol
sidebar_position: 1
description: Protocol to document conceptual restoration designs as referenced in LTPBR V2. 
---

The *LTPBR V2 Design Protocol* is used to develop conceptual restoration plans. It helps users visualize:

- **Proposed restoration structures** and their spatial & temporal distribution. 
- **Anticipated gemorphic & hydraulic changes** to the riverscape. 
- **Complex objectives** for multiple structures.

Essentially, the protocol allows restoration designs to convey the location, orientation, type, and expected hydrogeomorphic response of proposed structures. Users can create multiple designs to represent different phases of a project or to show various potential outcomes. Finally, the protocol allows users to digitize important riverscape features that might affect project logistics or influence the design itself.

## Layers 
 
The protocol uses seven layers to organize different aspects of a restoration design planning. These layers represent riverscape observations, structure locations, complex extents, and Zones of Influence (ZOI).

- **Structure locations** can be digitized as either points or lines, depending on user preference or knowing specific details like exact geometry or structure length.
- **Observations** are digitized as points, lines, or polygons to highlight different feature’s location, orientation, spatial distribution, or key attributes. 
- **Complex extents and ZOIs** are digitized as polygons to illustrate the area influenced by a single structure or group of structures.

*Example of LTPBR V2 Design protocol in practice at Bailey Flat. Digitized layer extents and symbology are stored in the QRiS geopackage and can be displayed in any QGIS (.qgz) project.*

PALS - Bank Attached|Wood Accumulation|PALS that are attached to the margin (bank) of the active channel. Generally intended to direct flow away from the attached bank and potentially encouraging bar formation and lateral erosion and/or migration of the active channel.
PALS - Bank Blaster|Wood Accumulation|PALS that are oriented to direct flow into a bank to enhance rates and magnitudes of bank erosion.
PALS - Channel Spanning|Wood Accumulation|PALS build with sufficient material to span an active channel. Generally intended to enhance channel aggradation rates and/or encourage floodplain connectivity.
