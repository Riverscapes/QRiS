:::tip[Final Version: Production Grade]

This protocol is production grade and fully supported in QRiS. Layers and metrics have been finalized by the owner to be used in data collection & metric calculation. Updates may occur to existing layers or metrics but will not result in data loss to the user.

## Overview

The *LTPBR V2 Design Protocol* is used to develop conceptual restoration plans. It helps users visualize:

- **Proposed restoration structures** and their spatial & temporal distribution. 
- **Anticipated gemorphic & hydraulic changes** to the riverscape. 
- **Complex objectives** for multiple structures.

Essentially, the protocol allows restoration designs to convey the location, orientation, type, and expected hydrogeomorphic response of proposed structures. Users can create multiple designs to represent different phases of a project or to show various potential outcomes. Finally, the protocol allows users to digitize important riverscape features that might affect project logistics or influence the design itself.

## Layers & Metrics 
 
The protocol uses seven layers to organize different aspects of a restoration design planning. These layers represent riverscape observations, structure locations, complex extents, and Zones of Influence (ZOI).

- **Structure locations** can be digitized as either points or lines, depending on user preference or knowing specific details like exact geometry or structure length.
- **Observations** are digitized as points, lines, or polygons to highlight different feature’s location, orientation, spatial distribution, or key attributes. 
- **Complex extents and ZOIs** are digitized as polygons to illustrate the area influenced by a single structure or group of structures.

*Example of LTPBR V2 Design protocol in practice at Bailey Flat. Digitized layer extents and symbology are stored in the QRiS geopackage and can be displayed in any QGIS (.qgz) project.*
