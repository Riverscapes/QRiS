description: A protocol for assessing barriers. 
---

The **Barrier Assessment Protocol** is an assessment of existing barriers or potential barriers to fish and/or beaver movement within the valley bottom. The protocol is based on stream crossing forms developed by the Southeast Aquatic Resources Partnership (SARP). This protocol is specifically utilized in LTPBR (Low-Tech Process-Based Restoration) monitoring to assess how barriers may impact the migration and movement of these organisms throughout the drainage network.

## How to Use 

Adding this protocol to your QRiS project allows you to map barrier locations and record key features. This includes: 
- **Crossing Information**: This section captures contextual details about the barrier, such as its type (e.g., culvert, ford, bridge, etc.), the crossing conditions at the site, and the overall barrier conditions (e.g., evidence of scour, riparian vegetation, constriction, etc.).
- **Outlet Assessment**: Assessment of the downstream end of the barrier including its outlet type, physical condition, and dimensions  (e.g., height, width, etc).
- **Inlet Assessment**: Assessment of the upstream end of the barrier including its outlet type, physical condition, and dimensions  (e.g., height, width, etc).
- **Additional Conditions**: Record other important observations about the barrier such as slope, substrate & flow conditions, sediment build-up, etc.
