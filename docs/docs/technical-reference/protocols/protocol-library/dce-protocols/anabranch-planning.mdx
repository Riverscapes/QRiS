This protocol is experimental and has not been finalized by the protocol owner. It can be changed at anytime which can break existing data or cause data loss. Please backup data if using this protocol.

## Overview 

The *Anabranch Planning Protocol* is the standardized protocol for planning riverscape projects & collecting pre-design field data at Anabranch Solutions. 

- **Stream Assessment** to assess riverscapes for LTPBR potential. 
- **Risk Assessment** to identify nearby infrastructure risks that could impact LTPBR actions. 
- **Property Assessment** to evaluate approval towards LTPBR by landowners and nearby stakeholders.
- **Recovery Space** to determine the area available for LTPBR recovery.
- **Metrics** to quantify risks and the range of potential recovery space.
