## Overview

The ***RIM (Riverscape Inundation Mapping) Protocol*** was created with the intent to replace The Riverscapes Inundation Mapper Tool, or RIM, that was developed as part of Karen Bartelt's Thesis (Bartelt et al. 2021) to aid in the efficient mapping of structurally forced inundation patterns in beaver impacted riverscapes. 



:::note
RIM layers can also be used in the [LTPBR V2 DCE Protocol](https://qris.riverscapes.net/technical-reference/protocols/protocol-library/dce-protocols/ltpbr-dce-protocol) with a more limited subset of metrics.

### Layer Attributes

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="thalwegs" label="Thalwegs">
    **Type**|**Description**
---|---
*Main*|The thalweg that follows the deepest point of the primary anabranch
*Anabranch*|Thalwegs that follow the deepest point of a fully formed (i.e. has an active channel bed) secondary anabranch that is longer than 2 ocularly estimated bankfull channel widths
*Split*|Thalwegs that follow the deepest point of structurally forced sheetflow, or short secondary anabranches
*Braid*|Thalwegs within the primary anabranch that are not the main thalweg and are not structurally forced by large wood or beaver dams. These typically depart and return from the main thalweg or an anabranch thalweg
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="dam crests" label="Dam Crests">
  **Dam State**|**Description**
---|---
*Intact*|A dam from which pond is fully maintained upstream of the dam
*Breached*|A dam where partial removal or loss of material from the dam crest results in a lowering of the pond water surface elevation
*Blown Out*|A dam where enough of the dam is breached or damaged such that the dam no longer backs up water

  **Crest Type**|**Description**
---|---
*Active*|The portion of the dam that is actively backing up water upstream of the dam
*Inactive*|The portion of the dam that is not actively backing up water upstream of the dam
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="inundation" label="Inundation">
    **Type**|**Description**
---|---
*Ponded*|structurally-forced backwater ponding upstream behind a channel-spanning structural element
*Overflow*|structurally-forced flow onto floodplain and/or otherwise exposed in channel surfaces (e.g. bars)
*Free Flowing*|not obstructed by a channel-spanning structural element
