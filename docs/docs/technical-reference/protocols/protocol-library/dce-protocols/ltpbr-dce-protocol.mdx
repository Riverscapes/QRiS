## Overview

The ***LTPBR V2 DCE (Data Capture Events) Protocol*** provides a standardized method for monitoring riverscape changes over time, using both visual and numerical data. This protocol enables users to digitize the location, distribution, and characteristics of riverscape features, which can then be used to assess the health and function of a riverscape. 

A key benefit of the DCE protocol is its versatility, allowing for riverscape assessments throughout all phases of a restoration project (design, implementation, and monitoring). This enables users to evaluate project effectiveness and identify potential changes where needed. It can also be used to identify areas with high restoration potential, thereby informing site selection for LTPBR projects.

:::note
QRiS offers powerful analytical functions that present data in both graphs and tables, enabling users to quantify temporal changes and identify limiting factors. This numerical and visual approach provides the necessary insights to make informed decisions for restoration projects. The system also allows for an unlimited number of DCEs per project, providing flexibility to organize riverscape surveys and assessments into distinct events or combine multiple surveys into a single DCE as required.

<summary>*How to Use This Protocol*</summary>

The protocol uses multiple layers organized into two separate groups. The *Observations* group contains layers related to riverscape features and structural elements, while the *Assessments* group contains layers related to risk potential, channel evolution models, and beaver dam building. 

- *Observations*: structural elements, observations, vegetation extents, inundation extents, active extents, active channel, active channel lines, channel junctions, geomorphic unit extents, geomorphic units.
- *Assessments*: risk potential, SEM Cluer and Thorne, dam crests, recovery potential. 
</details>

    **Type**|**Description**
---|---
*Primary*|The continuous channel thread that carries the largest proportion of the total surface flow
*Non-Primary*|Any other active channel thread. Non-primary channels are separated from the main channel by islands that are generally vegetated. Non-primary channels should not be drawn for thalwegs around bar features that are still a part of the active channel

**Description**|**Description**
---|---
*Centerline*|The approximate centerline of the active channel
*Thalweg*|The approximate thalweg, which is generally the deepest point along a channel cross-section or point that carries the greatest amount of flow.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="active extents" label="Active Extents">
    **Type**|**Description**
---|---
*Active*|The combined portion of the valley bottom classified as part of the active channel and floodplain under the current geomorphic and hydrologic conditions.
*Inactive*|The portion of the valley bottom that is not part of the active channel or floodplain under current geomorphic and hydrologic conditions.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="channel junctions" label="Channel Junctions">
  **Type**|**Description**
---|---
*Diffluence*|Location where an active, non-primary channel splits away (diverges) from the primary channel or another non-primary channel. Difluences are the upstream end of any non-primary active channel
*Confluence (Anabranch)*|Approximate location where an active non-primary channel reenters the primary channel or another non-primary channel. Confluences are the downstream end of any non-primary active channel
*Confluence (Tributary)*|Location where a tributary enters an active channel
*Channel Head*|Channel heads are one mechanism in which new anabranches are created. Channel heads are distinguished as the most upstream point at which flow becomes concentrated between definable banks. The downstream point in which the anabranch channel meets the main channel should be marked as a channel head confluence
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sem cluer and thorne" label="Cluer and Thorne">
  **SEM Stage**|**Description**
---|---
*Stage 1-Sinuous, Single Thread*|Dynamically stable and laterally active channel within a floodplain complex
*Stage 2-Channelized*|Re-sectioned land drainage, flood control, or navigation channels
*Stage 3-Degradation/Arrested Degradation*|Incising and abandoning its floodplain. Featuring head cuts, knick points or knick zones that incise into the bed, scours away bars and riffles and removes sediments stored at bank toes. Banks stable geotechnically.
*Stage 4-Degradation and Widening*|Incising with unstable, retreating banks that collapse by slumping and/or rotational slips. Failed material is scoured away, and the enlarged channel becomes disconnected from its former floodplain, which becomes a terrace.
*Stage 5-Aggradation and Widening*|Bed rising, aggrading, widening channel with unstable banks in which excess load from upstream together with slumped bank material build berms and silts bed. Banks are stabilizing and berming.
*Stage 6-Quasi Equilibrium*|Inset floodplain re-established quasi-equilibrium channel with two-stage cross-section featuring regime channel inset within larger, degraded channel. Berms stabilize as pioneer vegetation traps fine sediment, seeds and plant propagules.
*Stage 7-Laterally Active*|Channel with frequent floodplain connection develops sinuous course, is laterally active and has symmetrical cross-section promoting bar accretion at inner margins and toe scour and renewed bank retreat along outer margins of expanding/migrating beds
*Stage 8-Anastomosing Meta-Stable Channel Network*|Post-disturbance channel featuring anastomosed planform connected to a frequently inundated floodplain that supports wet woodland or grassland that is bounded by set-back terraces on one or both margins.
*Stage 0-Anastomosing Wet Woodland or Anastomosing Grassed Wetland*|Pre-disturbance, dynamically meta-stable network of anabranching channels and floodplain with vegetated islands supporting wet woodland or grassland

### Metric Attributes

:::warning
All metrics in LTPBR V2 DCE are calculated within the sample frames polygon layer. Any digitized features outside of the sample frame polygon will not be calculated within QRiS. Furthermore, all density and ratio metrics are normalized by either the valley bottom area, valley bottom length, or channel area.
