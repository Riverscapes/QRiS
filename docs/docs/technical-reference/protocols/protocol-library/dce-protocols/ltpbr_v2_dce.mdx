description: Protocol to capture riverscape feature observations and riverscape assessments based on LTPBR V2. 
---
The *LTPBR V2 DCE (Data Capture Events) Protocol* provides a standardized method for monitoring riverscape changes over time, using both visual and numerical data. This protocol enables users to digitize the location, distribution, and characteristics of riverscape features, which can then be used to assess the health and function of a riverscape. 

A key benefit of the DCE protocol is its versatility, allowing for riverscape assessments throughout all phases of a restoration project (design, implementation, and monitoring). This enables users to evaluate project effectiveness and identify potential changes where needed. It can also be used to identify areas with high restoration potential, thereby informing site selection for LTPBR projects.

QRiS offers powerful analytical functions that present data in both graphs and tables, enabling users to quantify temporal changes and identify limiting factors. This numerical and visual approach provides the necessary insights to make informed decisions for restoration projects. The system also allows for an unlimited number of DCEs per project, providing flexibility to organize riverscape surveys and assessments into distinct events or combine multiple surveys into a single DCE as required.
