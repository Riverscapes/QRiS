description: Protocol to evaluate infrastructure risks and recovery potential.
---

The Risk Assessment Protocol is designed to identify and evaluate potential restoration risks to infrastructure and assess recovery potential in valley bottoms. The protocol consists of four key components:
- **Stream Assessment**: This component evaluates LTPBR opportunities within streams.   
- **Land Use Assessment**: This step analyzes current and historical land use to gauge the recovery potential of restoration. 
- **Infrastructure Risk Assessment**: This focuses on identifying and assessing risks to infrastructure typically found in valley bottoms, such as buildings, roads, bridges, canals, and diversions.
- **Property Assessment**: This final component assesses input and support for LTPBR from local property owners, managers, and stakeholders.

## Layers

Attribute|Type|Description
---|---|---
*Stream Assessment*|Linestring|evaluate LTPBR opportunity by assessing stream order, bank material, bed material, riparian vegetation health, and flood risk. 
*Land Use Assessment*|Polygon|evaluate current and estimated historic land use of the valley bottom, as well as the departure of current riparian vegetation from historical conditions.
*Infrastructure Risk Assessment*|Point, Linestring, and Polygon|assign a categorical risk value to identified infrastructure within the valley bottom based on its location to the stream and other relevant factors, such as flood risk.
*Property Assessment*|Point|evaluate the willingness of the landowner or manager to permit LTPBR processes on their property, and gauge the general attitudes of local property owners and stakeholders towards LTPBR.
