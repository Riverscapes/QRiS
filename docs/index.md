**Riverscapes Studio** - for [QGIS](https://plugins.qgis.org/) or **QRiS** (pronounced curious) is where you come to work on _your_ riverscapes. QRiS takes care of the housekeeping and lets you focus on understanding your riverscape.

QRiS is targeted at anyone interested in understanding and analyzing their riverscapes, such as:  _practitioners, managers, analysts, researchers_ and _students_ with some familiarity with GIS. QRiS helps _users_ with analysis, monitoring, and  assessment of riverscapes as well as preparation of the design and as-builts of [low-tech process-based restoration projects](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu/resources/Topics/04_Design/).

[We]({{ site.baseurl }}/About/acknowledgements.html) seek for QRiS to become the flagship, [professional-grade tool](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/discrimination.html#tool-grade) of the [Riverscapes Consortium](http://riverscapes.net). The free, [open-source tool]({{ site.baseurl }}/About/license) is a [plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/) to the free, open-source [QGIS](https://plugins.qgis.org/) software. 

See the QRiS sister tool: RV - [Riverscapes Viewer](http://rave.riverscapes.net) to help visualize [riverscapes projects](https://riverscapes.net/Tools/Technical_Reference/Documentation_Standards/Riverscapes_Projects/) <img src="https://riverscapes.net/assets/images/data/RiverscapesProject_24.png">.

**QRiS is in Development & Beta Testing** and is only in the experimental plugin library of GIS. Version 1.0 is scheduled for release in late Spring 2023.

## What's a Riverscape?

A riverscape is the part of the landscape that could plausibly flood in the contemporary natural flow regime.
